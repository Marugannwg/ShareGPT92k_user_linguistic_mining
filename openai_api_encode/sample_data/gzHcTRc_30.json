      "value": "later on the book outline. I want to give you all the steps and other elements of the epoch way to your memory so you can help me say it clearer for those who want to learn it. It may help to know I have always considered it to be an inside out growth journey for both the individual person and a business. \nbecause the first step often comes when we are at the end of our rope I have had trouble helping others who are still hanging onto their ideas about how the world was actually designed to work and how they think it works. I know it took me being on the verge of losing everything, miserable with life and work, getting betrayed, and feeling completely lost before I decided to exert my personal power to drive change in my own life. even then I stumbled into and through it accidently. It took a confluence of events happening on the outside that drove me to change on the inside. \nI am convinced it does not have to be that way for everyone. They could get their internal and external worlds aligned on purpose to actually feel the resonance and harmony produce a powerful individual peace of mind that gives them clarity and opens them up to higher and deeper perspectives than their peers. \nWhen it comes to work, leadership, and entrepreneurship it is often more subtle, but not always. It could be an everyday process that is harder than it has to be that we are tolerating. It could be a prima donna, drama inducing employee, or needing to figure out a way to pay the bills, or it could be facing bankruptcy. \nSo I tried to present it as a internal dissonance, a low grade hum, a sense of dread with no obvious source happening in the background of our lives. Often we dont even notice it because we are so busy, so distracted, we dont realize internal harmony is available. We come to believe this is just the way life is. \nSo driving change is often preceded by a dramatic wake up call, when it could be noticed in the quiet moments of our lives if we listened to the 'still small voice' in our head. When it comes to work I want to let people know it does not have to be that dramatic. It can be a part of the culture a value to live and work by. The hard part is getting people to notice, be aware, awake, to the feeling of dissatisfaction, tolerating frustrating inefficiencies and drama inducing dysfunction. Most people do not want to go there on there own, don't want to think about whats wrong, and often deny there is. \nI have found most people don't really know what they want. When asked they usually say something that amounts to more money, more love, or most often something less impactful. With tradespeople, whom I work with the most, who need these ideas the most, they often just shrug and say I don't know or give a flippant answer. Even people who give a meaningful answer they have no idea they have the power within themselves to get what they want because they first must have clarity about what it is they most want. \nWhen I consider history, psychology, religious texts, natural science and neuroscience, entrepreneurship, leadership, the most impactful marketing, best selling books, other transformation programs, what I see is one idea said millions of different ways- seems to be collective pursuit of personal fulfillment. Freedom to make an impact in the world, help others in meaningful ways, to make a difference. But, past dreams, past attempts at building a business, past hopes of being in a deeply connected community, often ended in disappointment, embarrassment, financial collapse, or betrayal. \nWhile not easily admitting it, even the most resilient, shrink inside, shrink their dreams, hopes, and desires, to something akin to making a living to take care of the family. That is where I think the majority of the internal dissonance comes from and why people are often so slow at recovering the very thing they need and most want in their lives- a prosperous freedom deeply rooted in peace of mind. \nPlease consider this while also including what you already understand about the epoch way and driving change and give me a full explanation of it that we can use together to bring clarity to its powerful concepts and offer hope to those who have settled for less because it is safe.",

      "value": "The Epoch Way is a holistic approach to personal and professional growth that focuses on aligning one's internal and external worlds in order to achieve a sense of harmony and peace of mind. According to the author, the majority of problems in the world stem from misunderstandings about God and our true nature as spiritual beings. Using a combination of the latest research in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, spirituality, and entrepreneurship, the author aims to help individuals and businesses overcome internal dissonance and achieve a state of prosperity and freedom deeply rooted in peace of mind.\n\nThe journey towards this state begins with recognizing the internal dissonance that many individuals and businesses experience, often in the form of a low-grade hum or sense of dread. This dissonance is often caused by a disconnect between our inner selves and the external world, and can be the result of tolerating frustrating inefficiencies and drama-inducing dysfunction in our work and personal lives.\n\nThe first step in the Epoch Way is to become aware of this internal dissonance and to question the status quo. This can be a difficult process, as many people are not aware of the feeling of dissatisfaction and may not want to confront it. However, it is only by recognizing this internal dissonance that individuals and businesses can begin to make meaningful changes.\n\nOnce an individual or business has become aware of their internal dissonance, the next step is to gain clarity about what they truly want in life and work. This requires introspection and self-reflection, and may involve answering questions such as \"What is my purpose?\", \"What am I meant to do in this world?\", and \"What kind of impact do I want to make?\".\n\nWith this newfound clarity, individuals and businesses can begin to take action to align their internal and external worlds. This may involve making changes to their personal and professional lives, such as finding a new job or starting a business. It may also involve shifting their mindset and perspective, and learning to see the world in a new way.\n\nUltimately, the goal of the Epoch Way is to help individuals and businesses achieve a state of prosperity and freedom deeply rooted in peace of mind. This may involve breaking free from limiting beliefs and societal expectations, and embracing one's true purpose and passions. It also involves learning to work in harmony with others, fostering deep connections, and making a positive impact on the world.\n\nOverall, the Epoch Way is a powerful approach to personal and professional growth that encourages individuals and businesses to question the status quo, gain clarity about what they truly want, and take action to align their internal and external worlds in order to achieve a state of prosperity and freedom deeply rooted in peace of mind.",

The first step in this process is recognizing the internal dissonance, or low grade hum, of dissatisfaction that often exists in our lives without us even realizing it. This can manifest in many different ways, such as tolerating frustrating inefficiencies or drama in the workplace, or feeling a sense of dread or unhappiness without a clear cause.\n\nTo drive change and move towards true fulfillment, individuals must first become aware of this internal dissonance and take responsibility for their own growth and development. This includes gaining clarity on what they truly want in their lives, and having the courage to pursue those desires despite any fear or doubt that may arise.\n\nThe next step is to take action and make changes in their daily lives that will bring them closer to their desired outcome. This can involve setting specific, measurable goals, and creating a plan to achieve them. It also means being open to new perspectives, learning from others, and being willing to adapt and pivot as necessary.\n\nThroughout this process, individuals must also focus on developing a sense of inner peace and harmony, as this will be the foundation upon which all of their efforts are built. This can be accomplished through practices such as meditation, mindfulness, and self-reflection.\n\nOnce individuals have achieved this level of personal fulfillment and inner peace, they will be able to approach their professional lives with a renewed sense of purpose and direction. They will be able to lead with greater confidence, communicate more effectively, and make better decisions, all of which will result in greater success in their careers and businesses.\n\nIn summary, The Epoch Way is a powerful approach to personal and professional growth that helps individuals and businesses align their internal and external worlds in order to achieve true fulfillment and prosperity. By recognizing and taking responsibility for their own growth, setting specific goals, taking action, developing inner peace, and leading with purpose, individuals can drive change and create a more fulfilling and prosperous life for themselves and those around them.",
