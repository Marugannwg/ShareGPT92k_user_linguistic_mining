Add images or illustrations to each card to provide visual cues for each figure, house, characteristic, or combination.\n2. Use audio recordings or animations to enhance the learning experience.\n3. Add a scoring system or time limit to the flashcards, turning it into a game that encourages users to memorize the information quickly and accurately.\n4. Allow users to customize their own flashcards by selecting specific figures, houses, or characteristics they want to focus on.\n5. Integrate the flashcards into a larger online learning platform, where users can track their progress and receive feedback on their performance.\n6. Include interesting and informative facts or trivia about the figures, houses, or characteristics, to keep users engaged and motivated to learn more.\n7. Provide different levels of difficulty or different modes of play, so that users can challenge themselves and keep the learning experience fresh and engaging.\n\nTo keep the code lightweight, you can use efficient data structures and algorithms to store and retrieve the flashcard information, minimize the use of external libraries or resources, and optimize the code for speed and memory usage. You can also use caching or lazy loading to avoid loading unnecessary data or resources, and implement error handling and debugging features to ensure that the code runs smoothly and reliably.",
