Conceptualization stage: During this stage, the product manager is responsible for creating the product vision and defining the product strategy, including conducting market research, identifying customer needs, and analyzing the competitive landscape.\n2. Planning stage: In this stage, the product manager is responsible for creating the product roadmap, defining the features and functionalities of the product, and prioritizing the product backlog.\n3. Development stage: During this stage, the product manager works closely with the development team to ensure that the product is being developed according to the product roadmap and that all features are being built to meet customer needs.\n4. Testing stage: In this stage, the product manager is responsible for ensuring that the product is thoroughly tested for quality and usability, and that any issues or bugs are addressed before launch.\n5. Launch stage: During this stage, the product manager oversees the launch of the product, including coordinating with marketing and sales teams, monitoring user feedback, and making adjustments as necessary.\n\nWhile the product manager is accountable for the overall success of the product, other team members may be responsible for specific deliverables within each stage. For example, a marketing manager may be responsible for creating marketing campaigns during the launch stage, while a designer may be responsible for creating user interface designs during the development stage.
