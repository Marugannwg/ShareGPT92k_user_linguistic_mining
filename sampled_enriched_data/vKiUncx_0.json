      "value": "Rewrite this text for a scientific paper: One of the hotspots we mapped, hotspot #37, contained an extraordinarily large diversity of defense systems (Figures 4-6). This hotspot was almost always occupied (97.3%) in E. coli genomes, and when occupied it almost always (97.4%) contained at least one defense system, overall containing 31 different defense system types in different genomes (Figure 5; Figure 6). This hotspot therefore represents a position in the E. coli genome dedicated for containing defense systems. Curiously, the mode of mobilization of these systems between genomes could not be readily identified: While in some cases hotspot #37 contained prophages, satellite phages or integrative mobilizable elements (Figure 6), in the majority of cases (67.1%) we were unable to identify an MGE associated with defense systems at this hotspot (Table S2). Notably, a recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes encode two highly diverse hotspots that seem to be similarly dedicated to encoding defense systems with no identifiable mode of mobilization (49).",
