      "value": "\"How to Live: A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer\" is a book by Sarah Bakewell that explores the life and work of Michel de Montaigne, a French Renaissance philosopher and essayist. The book is structured around twenty key themes that Montaigne addressed in his work, and it offers an accessible and engaging interpretation of his thoughts. Here are some major takeaways from the book:\n\n1. Embrace the complexity of human nature: Montaigne believed in accepting and understanding the full range of human emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. He encouraged his readers to delve into their own psyches and appreciate their unique experiences.\n2. Be skeptical and question everything: Montaigne was a proponent of skepticism and often questioned conventional wisdom. He urged readers to question their own beliefs and assumptions, as well as those of others, to arrive at a deeper understanding of the world.\n3. Cultivate self-awareness: One of Montaigne's most enduring contributions to philosophy is his emphasis on introspection and self-awareness. He believed that understanding oneself was crucial to living a good life and encouraged a constant examination of one's thoughts and actions.\n4. Accept uncertainty: Montaigne recognized that life is full of uncertainties and ambiguities. Instead of despairing over this fact, he suggested embracing it as a natural part of the human experience and learning to navigate it with grace and humility.\n5. Enjoy the present moment: Montaigne advocated for living in the present and appreciating the simple pleasures of life. He believed that happiness could be found in everyday experiences, like spending time with friends and family or enjoying a good meal.\n6. Practice empathy and understanding: Montaigne emphasized the importance of empathy and understanding in human relationships. He believed that by putting ourselves in others' shoes, we can foster greater compassion and tolerance.\n7. Develop a personal philosophy: Montaigne's essays were a form of self-exploration and a way for him to develop his own personal philosophy. Bakewell encourages readers to engage in a similar process, using Montaigne's work as a guide and inspiration for discovering their own values and principles.\n8. Embrace life's contradictions: Montaigne's writing often reflects his acceptance of life's contradictions and paradoxes. He believed that embracing these complexities, rather than trying to resolve them, is a more authentic and fulfilling way to live.\n9. Cultivate resilience: Montaigne's life was marked by personal loss and political turmoil, but he managed to maintain a sense of equanimity throughout. Bakewell suggests that cultivating resilience and adaptability is essential for navigating the challenges of life.\n10. Cherish friendship: Montaigne valued friendship deeply and believed that true friends could provide solace, understanding, and support in times of need. He encouraged readers to invest in their friendships and to be open to forming deep connections with others.",

My dad: My father immigrated here to the US from Vietnam in 1975 as a refugee of the war. In his early years in the US, he lived in various locations in the east and midwest. He worked low-paying and low-status jobs like washing dishes, all while putting himself through school without debt. He graduated from a small college with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and eventually moved to California where he worked in a few machine shops before starting his own shop which manufactures small metal parts such as springs. Heâ€™s always demonstrated industriousness and prioritized the wellbeing and security of his family.\n3. My mom: My mom also immigrated to the US from vietnam. Unlike my father, she grew up in a wealthy family, but she all but abandoned that wealth when she moved to the US. Sheâ€™s a very devout follower of Christ (I am not), and sheâ€™s sacrificed a lot throughout her life as a housewife to dedicate her life to raising me and my two sisters while my dad spent most of his time working.\n4. My sister, Tammy: Tammyâ€™s 26 (one year older than I am). Sheâ€™s always been an outstanding student, graduating with honors from Berkeley (EECS) and she was a state-level champion track and field athlete in highschool. During her college years, she came out to me as a lesbian, and in recent years, sheâ€™s continually evolved as she gains a better and better understanding of who they are (note: they recently identified as non-binary).",

      "value": "I think I practice industriousness and excellence in my profession as an engineer at an early stage startup (Cyral). \n\nI joined Cyral as a software engineer immediately upon graduation from UCSB with a BS in statistical science. My coursework was more focused on statistical concepts, and happened to involve a bit of coding here and there to process data to derive statistical insight. I never really prioritized schoolwork â€” instead, i dedicated much of my time to leading the UCSB data science club organization as its president (the clubâ€™s founder selected me to take on his role when he graduated). Besides running the club, I dedicated a lot of time to working data science internships. I attribute whatever little coding ability I had at the time I was hired at Cyral to the time I dedicated to leading the club and working as an intern. \n\nDespite my lacking software engineering experience, Cyralâ€™s cofounders, Srini (CTO) and Manav (CEO) took a bet and hired me as one of the first 10 engineers. Itâ€™s been nearly 4 years since then, and Iâ€™m now managing a team of 4 developers and a product designer.\n\nWhile Iâ€™ve demonstrated my ability to dedicate myself to work, there are a few things that worry me:\n1. I take adderall in a daily basis to help me focus on my work, and I donâ€™t feel this is sustainable.\n2. Iâ€™m worried that over-optimizing on work leads to me falling short in other aspects of my life that I could be pursuing. For example, I used to cook regularly and derived great pleasure from doing so, but in the past 2 years, Iâ€™ve seldom cooked a meal and usually order in through Doordash (not frugal)\n\nAt this point, I realize Iâ€™m likely not providing a comprehensive answer to your question, so please feel free to question me about anything Iâ€™ve said, and perhaps more importantly, what I havent talked about yet in order to arrive at a more comprehensive response to your question.",
