      "value": "In Act 3, Scene 1 of Macbeth, Banquo enters and reflects on the witches' prophecy that Macbeth will be king and that Banquo's descendants will also become kings. Macbeth greets Banquo and invites him to a solemn supper, where he plans to request Banquo's presence. Banquo agrees and says he will go for a ride before the supper. Macbeth expresses his fears about Banquo and his wisdom, which he thinks will guide his valor. Macbeth then calls two murderers and asks them if they have considered his previous speeches. He reminds them that he previously explained how Banquo held them under fortune, and he asks them to come to the door and wait until he calls them.",

      "value": "Lady Macbeth:\nDidn’t participate: Lady Macbeth may have been the driving force behind Macbeth's initial desire for power and control, but she is not shown to directly participate in any violent acts. Additionally, her guilt and descent into madness in later acts suggest she may have been remorseful for her earlier actions.\n\nRoss:\nDid participate: Ross may have been motivated by loyalty to Macbeth and a desire for power or reward. As a nobleman, he may have seen Banquo as a threat to Macbeth's rule and sought to eliminate him. Ross is also shown to be a cunning and ambitious character, who is not above using violence to achieve his goals.\n\nA Witch:\nDidn’t participate: The witches in Macbeth are known to be manipulative and cunning, but they are not depicted as physically participating in the murder of Banquo and Fleance. They may have influenced Macbeth through their prophecies, but they are not shown to take direct action.\n\nFinal Question:\nWe believe that Shakespeare intentionally left the identity of the Third Murderer as a mystery to add to the tension and unpredictability of the play. This keeps the audience guessing and allows for multiple interpretations of the events in the play. However, some may argue that it would have added clarity to the plot if the Third Murderer's identity was made clear. Ultimately, the choice to leave the Third Murderer's identity a mystery adds to the timeless appeal of the play and allows for continued exploration and discussion by audiences and scholars.",

It's unlikely that a witch would participate in a violent act like the murder of Banquo and Fleance.\n\nLady Macbeth:\nDidn't participate: Lady Macbeth has been instrumental in encouraging Macbeth to pursue his ambitions and commit murder, but she has not shown any inclination to participate in the actual acts of violence herself. Furthermore, Lady Macbeth is starting to feel the guilt of her actions, and the murder of Banquo and Fleance would only add to her burden.\n\nMacbeth:\nDidn't participate: Macbeth is the one who hires the two murderers, but he would have been putting himself at great risk by personally participating in the attack on Banquo and Fleance. It's also not clear what Macbeth would gain by participating, since he is already the one giving the orders.\n\nRoss:\nDid participate: Ross is a loyal supporter of Macbeth and has been shown to be willing to do his bidding. He has a lot to gain by participating in the attack on Banquo and Fleance, since it would demonstrate his loyalty and further ingratiate him to Macbeth. Furthermore, Ross may have felt compelled to participate in order to ensure that Macbeth's prophecy of becoming king would come true.\n\nFinal Question: Shakespeare never reveals who the Third Murderer is. Do you like that this remains a mystery or do you think it should be made clear? Explaining your opinion(s):\n\nAs a high school senior, I think it's interesting that the identity of the Third Murderer remains a mystery. It adds to the suspense and intrigue of the play, and allows the audience to speculate and form their own opinions about who the murderer might be. At the same time, I can understand why some people might prefer to have a clear answer. Either way, the mystery of the Third Murderer is just one of the many intriguing elements of Macbeth that continues to captivate audiences today.",

Banquo was a threat to Macbeth's reign, as he had a prophecy that his descendants would be kings. By getting rid of Banquo, Lady Macbeth would be ensuring the security of Macbeth's rule. Additionally, she was worried about Macbeth's guilt and the impact it was having on him. She likely felt that participating in the murder would help him feel better and also show her support. The fact that she was willing to go to such lengths to protect her husband and his rule demonstrates her unwavering loyalty and determination to help him succeed.",
