      "value": "I want you to consider the following requirements in writing the article: \n1. When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the article, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. \n2. You are to write in a tone that sounds like it was written by a human being. \n3. Strictly Do not repeat or rephrase any content in the article. All must be uniquely written \n4. You must write in a logical and organized manner, using subheadings, bullet points, tables and other tools to break up the text and make it easier to read. \n5. You should edit and proofread the articles carefully, check for spelling and grammar errors and making sure that the content flows logically. You are to fix grammar errors like Grammarly.com and Quillbot.com \n6. You will use a plagiarism checker like duplichecker.com to make sure that the content is original and not copied from other sources. \n7. The language should be easy to understand for homeowners who are self-representing in NCAT and not familiar with legal jargon. \n7. The tone should be professional and understanding of the target persona, while also providing clear and concise information on HIA small works contract. \n8. You must strictly follow the Australian English language in spelling \n9. Generate the output in markdown format. \n\nDo you understand?\n\nPlease write in English language.",

      "value": "What is a Construction Management Contract?\n\nA Construction Management Contract (CMC) is an alternative to a traditional building contract with a builder. Under a CMC, the owner (referred to as the \"principal\") engages a construction manager to manage and supervise the construction works on their behalf. The construction manager is responsible for arranging and supervising the performance of work by sub-contractors.\n\nIn certain CMCs, a third party referred to as the client's representative (CR) may also be involved. The CR is responsible for deciding on matters such as extension of time claims by the construction manager, giving directions to the construction manager, and inspecting the site to assess progress prior to the submission of each progress claim by the construction manager.\n\nPursuant to a CMC, there are two options for engaging subcontractors to complete the works. The first is where the subcontractors enter into individual trade contracts with the principal to carry out the required works. If the principal chooses to take this route, they will be responsible for payment of the subcontractors for the work completed. The alternative method is for the subcontractors to enter into individual trade contracts with the construction manager. In this case, the construction manager will be responsible for payment of the subcontractors, and this amount will be added to the payment claims provided to the owner by the construction manager.\n\nEach of the trade contracts entered into with the subcontractors will contain provisions relating to defect liability periods and warranties for work performed. The CMC may also contain a provision expressly stating that the construction manager will not be liable to the owner for any acts or omissions by the subcontractors. However, the construction manager can still be liable to the owner for any breach of the CMC or for failing to properly manage and arrange the carrying out of the works by the subcontractors.",

      "value": "H2: How Does a Construction Management Contract Work?\n\nA construction management contract involves engaging a construction manager to manage and supervise the project on behalf of the owner. Here's a closer look at how the contract works:\n\nThe Role of the Construction Manager:\n\nThe construction manager is responsible for managing and supervising the construction of the project. They work closely with the owner and the client's representative to ensure the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.\n\nComparison to Lump Sum Contracting:\n\nUnlike lump sum contracting, the construction manager is not accountable to the owner for the acts and omissions of the trade contractors. The construction manager's role is limited to managing and supervising trade contractors, rather than taking on the risk of their non-performance.\n\n'Cost Plus' Engagement:\n\nA construction management contract is a form of ‘cost plus' engagement. This means that the owner pays the actual cost of the project, plus a fee to the construction manager. This is in contrast to a lump sum contract, where the owner pays a fixed price for the entire project.\n\nBenefits of Engaging a Construction Manager:\n\nEngaging a construction manager has several benefits, including:\n\n* The construction manager can be engaged before the design has been finalised, making it well suited to fast-track projects.\n* The owner has complete visibility over the amounts payable to trade contractors.\n* The owner retains control at all times and benefits from the expertise of a construction manager whose interests align with its own.\n* The owner is less exposed in the event of a solvency event affecting the construction manager compared to a lump sum head contractor.",
