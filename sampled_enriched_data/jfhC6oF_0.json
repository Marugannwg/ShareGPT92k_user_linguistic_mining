SPACE - HEATHER LOCKLEAR and PEYTON MANNING are exploring a distant planet.\n\nHEATHER: Peyton, have you noticed anything strange about the readings here?\n\nPEYTON: (checking the readings) Actually, yes. It seems there's some sort of energy signature coming from deep beneath the planet's surface.\n\nHEATHER: We should check it out.\n\nAs they descend deeper into the planet's caverns, they come across a strange device that emits a powerful energy field.\n\nHEATHER: What is this thing?\n\nPEYTON: I'm not sure, but it seems to be some kind of technology we've never seen before.\n\nSuddenly, the device activates, and a blinding light fills the room. When the light dissipates, they are shocked to see NORM MACDONALD and GREG KINNEAR standing before them, alive and well.\n\nNORM: Hey there, friends. Long time no see.\n\nGREG: What the hell just happened?\n\nPEYTON: It seems this device has the power to revive the dead.\n\nHEATHER: (hugging Norm and Greg) I can't believe you're both back.\n\nNORM: (smiling) We couldn't stay dead, not when there's still so much universe to explore.\n\nAs they catch up on old times, they realize that the energy field is growing unstable, threatening to destroy the planet and everyone on it.\n\nGREG: We need to shut this thing down before it's too late.\n\nNORM: I've got an idea.\n\nNorm approaches the device and begins to tinker with it, using his vast knowledge of engineering to reprogram the device's energy field.\n\nHEATHER: What are you doing, Norm?\n\nNORM: If I can reprogram the energy field to absorb the planet's excess energy, we might be able to save it.\n\nAs Norm works, Greg and Peyton fend off waves of alien attackers, who have been drawn to the planet by the energy field.\n\nGREG: (blasting aliens with his laser gun) We need to hold them off until Norm's done.\n\nPEYTON: (using his incredible strength to take down a giant alien) I've got this. Keep working, Norm.\n\nFinally, Norm succeeds in reprogramming the device, and the energy field begins to absorb the excess energy, stabilizing the planet and saving everyone on it.\n\nHEATHER: You did it, Norm.\n\nNORM: (smiling) Of course I did. I'm Norm Macdonald.\n\nAs they fly off into space, Norm, Greg, Heather, and Peyton share a moment of gratitude and appreciation for the universe's many wonders and the gift of life itself.\n\nPEYTON: (smiling) You guys are the best team I could ever ask for.\n\nGREG: (smiling) And with Norm back in the game, we're unstoppable.\n\nNORM: (laughing) Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Greg. We've still got a whole universe to explore.\n\nFADE OUT.",
