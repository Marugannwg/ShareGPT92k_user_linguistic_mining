You are correct that one of the main benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to resist censorship, due to its decentralized nature. The decentralized structure of a blockchain allows it to be more resistant to tampering and censorship, because there is no single point of control that can be targeted by attackers.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that decentralization is not the only factor that determines the value or usefulness of a blockchain. While it is true that a highly decentralized blockchain may be better able to resist censorship and tampering, this is not the only potential benefit of using a blockchain. Other potential benefits of using a blockchain, regardless of its degree of decentralization, can include increased security, transparency, and the ability to verify the authenticity and ownership of digital assets.\n\nIn general, the choice of whether to use a blockchain or a different technology will depend on the specific needs and goals of the project. While a blockchain may be a good choice for some projects, it may not be the best choice for others.",
