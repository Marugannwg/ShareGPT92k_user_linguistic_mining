Macaque fights back fiercely, but the sheer number of duplicates is too much for him to handle.\n\n\"Wukong, let him go!\" Macaque yells, trying to break free.\n\nWukong chuckles as he watches his duplicates hold Macaque down. \"Why should I? I'm having so much fun!\"\n\nMK tries to kick and punch his way free, but the duplicates hold him tight. \"Let me go, you monster!\"\n\nWukong grins. \"Now, now, no need for name-calling. I just want to have a little chat with you.\"\n\nMacaque struggles against the duplicates. \"Let him go, Wukong! Fight me instead!\"\n\nBut Wukong just shakes his head. \"No, no, no. You're not the one I want to talk to. MK, I have a proposition for you.\"\n\nMK glares at him. \"I don't want anything from you.\"\n\nWukong's grin widens. \"Oh, but you might. You see, I'm looking for someone to be my apprentice. Someone to follow in my footsteps, learn my ways, and maybe even surpass me one day. And I think you, MK, have what it takes.\"\n\nMK's eyes widen in shock. \"I would never join you!\"\n\nWukong's smile fades. \"Suit yourself. But I won't take no for an answer.\"\n\nWith a flick of his wrist, the duplicates holding MK release their grip, and Wukong's cloud disappears into the distance. Macaque stands up, still breathing heavily from the fight.\n\n\"Are you okay, MK?\" he asks, looking at the boy with concern.\n\nMK nods, tears in his eyes. \"I'm fine. But we have to stop him. We have to find a way to beat him.\"\n\nMacaque nods. \"We will, MK. We'll find a way.\"",
