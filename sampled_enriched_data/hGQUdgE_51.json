      "value": "The Form I-129 is used to petition for nonimmigrant workers to come to the United States. Different classifications of nonimmigrant workers have different requirements and evidence that must be submitted with the petition. Some classifications, such as E-1 and E-2, require a treaty or international agreement between the United States and the alien's country of nationality. Other classifications, such as O-1A and P-2, require evidence of extraordinary ability or achievement in a specific field. Additionally, certain classifications require a written consultation from a recognized peer group or labor organization. There are also additional fees associated with certain classifications, such as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) fee for H-1B and H-1B1 petitions, and the Fraud Prevention and Detection fee for H-1B, L-1, and H-2B petitions. Additionally, certain beneficiaries residing in CNMI may be eligible for initial status without having to depart the CNMI. The petitioner is also liable for the reasonable cost of return transportation for an H-1B, H-2B, O, and P beneficiary who is dismissed before the end of the period of authorized admission.",
