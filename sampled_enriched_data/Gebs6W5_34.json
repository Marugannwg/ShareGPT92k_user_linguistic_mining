      "value": "Making Connection: The Therapeutic Relationship\nTransference and Countertransference\nA classic psychoanalytic concept, transference refers to when a client projects onto the therapist attributes that stem from unresolved issues with primary caregivers; therapists use the immediacy of these interactions to promote client insight (Scharff & Scharff, 1987). Countertransference refers to when therapists project back onto clients, losing their therapeutic neutrality and having strong emotional reactions to the client; these moments are used to help the therapist and client better understand the reactions the client brings out in others. In therapy with couples and families, the processes of transference and countertransference vacillate more than in individual therapy because of the complex web of multiple relationships.\n\nContextual and Centered Holding\nIn contrast to traditional psychoanalysts, who are viewed as neutral “blank screens,” object relations family therapists are more relationally focused, creating a nurturing relationship they call a holding environment. They distinguish between two aspects of holding in family therapy: contextual and centered (Scharff & Scharff, 1987). Contextual holding refers to the therapist’s handling of therapy arrangements: conducting sessions competently, expressing concern for the family, and being willing to see the entire family. Centered holding refers to connecting with the family at a deeper level by expressing empathetic understanding to create a safe emotional space.\n\nMultidirected Partiality\nThe guiding principle for relating to clients in contextual family therapy is multidirectional partiality, that is, being “partial” with all members of the family (Boszormenyi-Nagy & Krasner, 1986). Therapists must be accountable to everyone who is potentially affected by the interventions, including those not immediately present in the room, such as extended family members. This principle of inclusiveness means that the therapist must bring out the humanity of each member of the family, even the “monster member” (Boszormenyi-Nagy & Krasner, 1986). In practice, multidirectional partiality generally involves sequential siding with each member by empathizing with each person’s position in turn.",

      "value": "Empathic Attunement\nEmpathic attunement is an essential component of the therapeutic relationship in psychodynamic family therapies. Empathy means more than simply understanding or intellectually grasping another person’s experience. It requires an emotional connection, an ability to resonate with the client’s feelings, to feel what they are feeling. Empathic attunement is the therapist’s ability to “tune in” to the client’s emotional state, thereby creating a sense of safety, trust, and security that can promote the therapeutic process (Scharff & Scharff, 1987).\n\nUse of Self\nUnlike traditional psychoanalysts, who tend to maintain a neutral, detached demeanor, psychodynamic family therapists are more open to using themselves in the therapeutic process. They understand that they are part of the system and that their actions, words, and even facial expressions can have an impact on the family (Scharff & Scharff, 1987). By being more active and engaged, therapists can model new ways of relating to self and others, help clients to learn more adaptive behaviors, and create new experiences that promote healing and change.",

By gaining insight, individuals can make more informed choices and take more conscious, intentional action in their lives.\n* Healing from attachment wounds: Object relations therapists focus on the impact of early attachment relationships on individuals' self-concept, interpersonal relationships, and psychological functioning. Thus, a common goal is to address and heal attachment wounds, promoting more secure attachment and healthier relationships.\n* Enhancing emotional regulation: Individuals who struggle with emotional dysregulation may benefit from psychoanalytic therapies that focus on identifying and addressing the underlying emotional processes that contribute to mood swings, anxiety, and other symptoms.\n* Improving interpersonal communication and conflict resolution: In family and couples therapy, a common goal is to improve communication patterns and develop more effective conflict resolution skills.

      "value": "The Doing: Interventions\nListening, Interpreting, and Working Through\nIn general, psychoanalytic therapies use three generic interventions:\n\nListening and Empathy: The primary tool of psychoanalytic therapists is listening objectively to the client’s story without offering advice, reassurance, validation, or confrontation. Empathy may be used to help the family to nondefensively hear the therapist’s interpretation of their unconscious dynamics.\n\nInterpretation and Promoting Insight: Like other psychoanalytic therapists, family psychoanalytic therapists encourage insights into interpersonal dynamics by offering interpretations to the client, such as by analyzing self-object relations or analyzing ledgers of entitlement and indebtedness.\n\nWorking Through: Working through is the process of translating insight into new action in family and other relationships. Changing one’s behavior on the basis of new insight is often the most difficult part of therapy. Understanding that you are projecting onto your partner feelings and expectations that really belong in your relationship with your mother is not too difficult; changing how you respond to your partner when you feel rejected and uncared for is more challenging.\n\nEliciting\nIn contextual therapy, eliciting uses clients’ spontaneous motives to move the family in a direction that is mutually beneficial and dialogical (Boszormenyi-Nagy & Krasner, 1986). The therapist facilitates this process by integrating the facts of the situation, each person’s individual psychology, and interactive transitions to help the family rework the balances of entitlement and indebtedness, helping each member to reinterpret past interactions and identify new ways to move forward.\n\nDetriangulating\nLike other systemic therapists, psychoanalytic therapists identify situations in which the parents have triangulated a symptomatic child into the relationship to deflect attention from their couple distress (Framo, 1992). Once the child’s role is made clear, the therapist dismisses the symptomatic child from therapy and proceeds to work with the couple to address the issues that created the need for the child’s symptoms.\n\nFamily-of-Origin Therapy\nFramo (1992) developed a three-stage model for working with couples that involved couples therapy, couples group therapy, and family-of-origin therapy. Therapists begin working with the couple alone to increase insight into their personal and relational dynamics. Next, the couple join a couples group, where they receive feedback from other couples and also view their dynamics; for many couples, insight comes more quickly when they see their problem dynamic acted out in another couple. Finally, each individual member of the couple is invited to have a 4-hour-long session with his/her family of origin without the other partner present. These extended family-of-origin sessions are used to clarify and work through past and present issues, thereby freeing individuals to respond to their partners and children without the “ghosts” of these past attachments.",

      "value": "Transference Analysis\nObject relations therapists view the transference as an important aspect of the therapeutic process. They analyze the transference to gain insight into the dynamics of the relationship between the family members, as well as between the family members and the therapist. The therapist looks for the ways in which the client is projecting onto others, as well as the ways in which the client is experiencing the projections of others. By analyzing transference, the therapist can help the family members understand their unconscious motivations and patterns of behavior.\n\nTherapeutic Neutrality\nIn contrast to other forms of family therapy, psychoanalytic therapies aim for a high degree of neutrality on the part of the therapist. The therapist is not there to take sides or to judge the family members. Instead, the therapist aims to create a safe and nonjudgmental space where the family members can explore their emotions and experiences.\n\nWorking with the Therapeutic Relationship\nPsychoanalytic therapies focus on the therapeutic relationship between the therapist and the family members. The therapist seeks to create a holding environment in which the family members feel safe to explore their unconscious motivations and emotions. The therapist also looks for opportunities to use the therapeutic relationship as a tool for change. For example, if a family member is struggling with issues of trust, the therapist may use the therapeutic relationship to model trustworthy behavior and to help the family member develop more trust in others.\n\nThe Use of Dreams and Fantasy\nPsychoanalytic therapies also make use of dreams and fantasy as tools for exploration and insight. Dreams and fantasy are seen as windows into the unconscious, and they can provide important clues about a person's emotions, motivations, and relationships. The therapist may encourage family members to discuss their dreams and fantasies, and may use these as a starting point for further exploration and interpretation.\n\nFree Association\nFree association is another tool used in psychoanalytic therapies. The therapist encourages the family members to speak freely and without censorship, allowing unconscious thoughts and emotions to surface. This can be a powerful tool for promoting insight and for helping family members to understand their own motivations and patterns of behavior.",
