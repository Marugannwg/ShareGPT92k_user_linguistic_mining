      "value": "How I overcame my prejudices\nStory time of my own life\nThis is a story that I have experienced by myself.\nIt was a rough day. It was a Friday, and my Fridays are always quite busy. This Friday especially. It started with school, like always. Afterwards, I heeded home, because had a lot of dates coming. At home, I just packed my stuff because I was going to my dads place this weekend. But first I had a dance training and after that basketball training, which is always quite stressful, but I do love it the way it is. For the reason, that I wanted to go to my dads, I had some baggage with me. And here it comes. That was the reason, why I couldn’t drive in the city with my bike. That is what I usually do because our buses here often are just not coming or are really late, and I could not take one earlier, because I needed to pack and eat. But I tried to drive with the bus. Because sometimes it is working out, and I had hope. So I was standing at the bus station and waited, waited and waited. The bus did not come. I was struggling, because there was not much time left. I phoned my mum if she could bring me closer to the city, because the buses there are driving more often, then here. Thankfully, she did. At the bus station, I was one step closer to arrive at the training on time. But then the bus at the other bus station also didn’t come. I was struggling and sad. I really didn’t want to miss a dance lesson. It is always so much fun and the choreography goes on, so I would miss a part.\nBack to our bus station. I stood there waiting with another girl for quite a while. Finally, then a smaller bus came, which actually looked like a bigger and longer car. But at least the bus had a number on the front board. The bus driver lowered his window and said that he could take me, and the other girl, with him. He was on his way to the airport, but he said he could take us to the city. I was struggling. It was a bus, but not a real bus. The driver was not looking German. He had a strong accent, and he couldn’t speak German that good. I looked at the girl. She was also uncertain what to do. The bus did not look like an official bus and nobody was sitting there, so I got sceptical. My mind got nervous. He was a foreigner, what about he is a kidnapper or all the others\n1\n\n story’s you get to hear have gone through my mind. But at this moment, I remembered my English lesson of the day. We talked about prejudices and racism. And also about if it is okay to label someone just because of his outward appearance.\nAt this moment, I was going to realise that I was keeping off the bus because of prejudices reasons. That was the point where I changed my attitude and thought:”No, Lara, you do not want to be like this.” So I decided that I would enter the bus, because I do not want to label someone who I just do not know. That is not the person I want to be. And usually I’m always really friendly to everyone. So I said:” Yes, thank you so much”. I went in the bus. I exchanged some looks with the girl, and I asked her to enter the car as well. She had some doubts, but I could convince her not to stay with her prejudices. For this reason, we drove to the city. And nothing happened. The man was really nice, and I just missed 10 minutes, just the warm-up, which was manageable.\nAfter this, I was a kind of happy, because my trust I put into this person was justified. In this situation, I overcame my prejudices, and I was happy that I had a positive perspective on the situation. I could realise that prejudices are holding you back from positive experiences. It was a great experience to treat the foreigner equal.\nI’m really grateful that I could experience a situation where I could realise what it means to change my mind and attitude about my prejudices. Just for the reason that I was able to reflect my attitude after we talked about prejudices in English lessons. I’m really happy that I had this experience, where I could apply theoretical knowledge into practical behaviour.",

Your writing is clear and easy to follow, and you effectively convey your emotions and thought process throughout the story. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make the essay even stronger.\n\nFirst, consider breaking the story into paragraphs to make it easier to follow. Each new idea or event should have its own paragraph.\n\nNext, pay attention to punctuation and sentence structure. There are a few instances where the sentence is incomplete or the punctuation is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, consider using more descriptive language to help paint a picture for the reader. For example, instead of saying \"the bus did not come,\" you could say \"the bus was nowhere to be seen.\"\n\nLastly, for more effective storytelling, it may be helpful to include more background information. For example, you mention that you were going to your dad's place, but don't explain why or how that factored into your experience.\n\nOverall, it's clear that you have a strong understanding of the subject matter and effectively convey your emotions and thoughts. With a little more attention to detail, your writing will be even stronger.",
