The foundation of quantum mechanics was laid by Max Planck in 1900, when he introduced the idea of quantized energy. In 1905, Albert Einstein used Planck's concept to explain the photoelectric effect, which was a phenomenon that couldn't be explained by classical physics. In the following years, several other scientists made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics, including Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, Erwin Schr√∂dinger, and Werner Heisenberg. By the mid-1920s, the basic principles of quantum mechanics were established, and the field has continued to evolve and expand since then.",
