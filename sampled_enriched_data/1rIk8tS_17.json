It was clear that Jinju was no longer able to hold water, and she would have to be retired.\n\nThe villagers were sad to see Jinju go, but they knew that she had served them well for many years. They took care to mend her cracks as best they could, and placed her in a special spot in the village where she could be remembered and admired for all that she had done.",

      "value": "Park Sooyoung was a skilled potter who lived in a small village nestled in the mountains. She was known for her beautiful and functional pots, which she made using traditional techniques passed down from her ancestors.\n\nOne day, a group of villagers approached Park Sooyoung with a special request. They needed a pot that could carry water from the well to their homes, and they wanted it to be sturdy and reliable. Park Sooyoung accepted the challenge and set to work, using her expert pottery skills to create a small, round clay pot with a narrow neck and sturdy handle.\n\nShe named the pot Jinju, and the villagers were thrilled with the finished product. Jinju quickly became an integral part of the village, carrying water for the villagers every day. In the winter months, Jinju was used to carry hot water from the village's communal fireplace to the homes of the villagers. She was wrapped in layers of cloth to keep the water warm and to protect the villagers' hands from the heat. During the hot summer months, Jinju was used to carry cold water from the well to the homes of the villagers.\n\nOn special occasions, Jinju was used to carry sake or other traditional Korean beverages to the village's communal gatherings. On days when the villagers needed to wash their clothes, Jinju was used to carry hot water from the well to the village's communal washing area. And during the village's annual festivals, Jinju was used to carry water for the villagers to use to clean and purify themselves in preparation for the festivities.\n\nAs Jinju was used and carried water for the villagers every day, she began to show signs of wear and tear. Over time, small cracks began to form in her surface, gradually spreading and deepening. These cracks were caused by the constant pressure of the water inside Jinju, as well as the rough handling and frequent bumps and jolts she experienced as she was carried from place to place.\n\nAt first, the cracks were small and barely noticeable, but as Jinju continued to be used, they grew larger and more numerous. Eventually, one of the cracks became so large that it threatened to split Jinju in two. The villagers knew that they had to do something to repair Jinju before it was too late.
