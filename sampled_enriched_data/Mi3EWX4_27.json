The timeline includes seven major tasks that need to be completed, including conducting market research, developing a business plan, registering the company, building the online platform, sourcing investment opportunities, marketing the platform, and launching the platform. Each task has a specific start and end date, with an estimated duration and dependencies on other tasks.\n\nDuring the first month, the company will conduct market research to identify potential investors, competitors, and market trends. This will provide a better understanding of the demand for investment opportunities in the construction industry. After that, the team will develop a detailed business plan that outlines the goals, target audience, marketing strategy, revenue streams, and financial projections.\n\nOnce the business plan is complete, the company will register as a legal entity, establish a bank account to manage funds and build a user-friendly and secure online platform. The platform will provide detailed information about each investment opportunity to potential investors. The company will establish relationships with construction companies and developers to vet and analyze investment opportunities.\n\nIn the last month, the company will launch the platform, accept investments, and begin managing investments while providing regular updates on the progress of construction projects. The company will implement a marketing strategy to promote the platform to potential investors and distribute dividends to investors from profits obtained from the sale of newly built objects.\n\nOverall, the Gantt chart and tasks outline the creation of a successful investment company in the construction industry that offers a unique opportunity to invest in the construction of residential buildings through an online platform.",
