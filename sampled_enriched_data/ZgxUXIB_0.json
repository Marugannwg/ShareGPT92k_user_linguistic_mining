Keep the level of formality.\n\nDear Councilmember [Name],\n\nI would like to add my support as a constituent in [Neighborhood] to a bill that was recently introduced, # Int 0501-2022. This bill would help in the enforcement of blocked bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, which any pedestrian or biker in NYC knows is a massive problem. Blocked lanes and sidewalks are a contributing factor to our deadly traffic problem, forcing bikers and pedestrians into traffic and creating an inconvenience and hazard to everyone else.\n\nI like this bill because it builds off the success of the idling commercial truck laws, which allow citizens to report violations â€” adding actual consequences to breaking the law and providing an additional revenue stream for the city.\n\nTypically, when we report bike lane blockages via 311, the police response is non-existent and therefore enforcement is non-existent. Many people feel free to use the bike lanes as their personal parking space, and they take advantage of that to the fullest. Allowing citizens to report these blockages directly would show the people of NYC that they can't simply block these lanes and sidewalks without a fine, at a minimum. It would also bring in an underutilized source of revenue for the city at no real additional cost.\n\nIn asking for your support of this bill I would also ask that while the bill is in committee the language is updated to remove the 1320-foot school proximity requirement so that it can be enforced citywide.\n\nI hope we can count on your support for this bill!\n\nThanks, [Name]",
