      "value": "Choosing a tarot spread depends on the question or area of your life that you want to explore with the cards. Here are a few common tarot spreads and what they can be used for:\n\n1. Three-card spread: This is a simple and versatile spread that can provide insights into the past, present, and future of a situation. The first card represents the past, the second card represents the present, and the third card represents the future.\n2. Celtic Cross spread: This is a more complex spread that can provide a deeper analysis of a situation. It includes 10 cards, with each card representing a different aspect of the situation, such as the present situation, the challenge, the past, the future, and the outcome.\n3. Relationship spread: This spread is specifically designed to explore relationships, whether romantic, platonic, or professional. It can include a range of cards that represent the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship, the feelings of each person involved, and any obstacles that may need to be overcome.\n4. Career spread: This spread can help you gain insights into your career or professional life. It may include cards that represent your strengths and weaknesses, your current job or career path, any obstacles or challenges you may be facing, and your future career prospects.\n\nUltimately, the choice of tarot spread will depend on what area of your life you want to explore and what questions you want to ask the cards. Feel free to modify or create your own tarot spread if none of the above feel right for you.",

      "value": "Based on the cards you drew, here's one possible interpretation of your three-card spread:\n\n1. Past (Strength): The Strength card is often associated with inner strength, courage, and self-discipline. In the past, you may have needed to draw on your own reserves of inner strength to overcome challenges or obstacles. This card can also suggest that you have been successful in taming your own inner demons and that you have a strong sense of self-control.\n2. Present (Eight of Cups): The Eight of Cups is a card of transition and letting go. It suggests that you may be leaving something behind, whether it's a job, a relationship, or a way of thinking. This can be a difficult process, but ultimately, it's necessary for growth and progress. This card can also suggest a sense of disillusionment or dissatisfaction with your current situation.\n3. Future (Seven of Pentacles): The Seven of Pentacles is a card of patience and hard work. It suggests that you may be in a period of waiting, where you need to be patient and allow things to unfold in their own time. This card can also suggest that you are in the process of planting seeds for the future, whether that's in your career, your relationships, or your personal life.\n\nOverall, this spread suggests that you have a strong foundation of inner strength and self-discipline that has helped you overcome challenges in the past. However, you may currently be in a period of transition or letting go, where you need to be patient and allow things to unfold in their own time. The future holds the promise of growth and progress, but it may require hard work and patience on your part.",
