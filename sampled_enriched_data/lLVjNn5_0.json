      "value": "Sure, here's an idea for a game jam with the theme \"every 10 seconds\":\n\nTitle: Time Warp\n\nConcept: In Time Warp, you play as a character who is constantly jumping forward in time every 10 seconds. Every time you jump, you find yourself in a new location, and you have to navigate your way through a series of challenges and obstacles to progress to the next level.\n\nGameplay: Each level will have a unique layout, with different obstacles and enemies that you must overcome to progress. You'll need to use your wits and reflexes to avoid danger, find hidden paths, and collect power-ups to increase your abilities.\n\nEvery 10 seconds, the game will pause for a brief moment, and you'll be shown a glimpse of the next level. You'll have to memorize the layout and the obstacles you'll face in the next level, so that you can plan your movements and strategies accordingly.\n\nAs you progress through the game, the challenges will become increasingly difficult, and you'll need to use all of your skills and knowledge to make it to the end. The game will be timed, and the player with the fastest time at the end of the game will be the winner.\n\nTools: You can use any game engine or programming language you like to create your game, but it should be a 2D side-scroller with simple controls that are easy to learn. You can also use a variety of visual and audio effects to enhance the game's atmosphere and create an immersive experience for the player.\n\nThis game jam theme offers a lot of potential for creativity and innovation, so don't be afraid to experiment and try out new ideas. Good luck, and have fun!",
