      "value": "Introduction\n============\n\nGraphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice structure, has been widely studied in recent years due to its exceptional electronic and mechanical properties. Its high electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity, and high mechanical strength make it an ideal material for various applications such as electronics, energy storage, and biomedicine. However, the high cost and complexity of traditional methods of graphene production have limited its widespread use.\n\nRecently, scientists have been interested in a new method of creating graphene, known as laser-induced graphene (LIG). LIG is created by exposing a polymer substrate, such as polyimide or polyethylene, to a laser pulse. The intense heat generated by the laser causes the polymer to carbonize and form a graphene layer. This method is considered more cost-effective and scalable than traditional methods of graphene production, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or mechanical exfoliation.\n\nOne of the main reasons scientists use LIG for gas sensor is that it has high sensitivity and selectivity to different gases. This is due to the unique structure of LIG, which is composed of a large number of small graphene domains with a high surface area. This high surface area allows for more efficient absorption and detection of gases. Additionally, LIG has a high electrical conductivity, which makes it an ideal material for use in electronic gas sensors.\n\nHowever, there are some disadvantages of the method of making LIG. For example, LIG can be difficult to connect to electrical leads and wires separately. This can limit the scalability of LIG production for gas sensors and other applications. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a new method of creating LIG using copper nanoink with a one-pot process.\n\nIn this method, a polymer substrate is coated with a solution containing copper nanoparticles and then exposed to a laser pulse. The intense heat generated by the laser causes the polymer to carbonize and form a graphene layer, while the copper nanoparticles are simultaneously reduced to copper, forming electrical connections. This eliminates the need for separate wire connections, improving the efficiency and scalability of LIG production for gas sensors and other applications.\n\nIn this paper, we will present the details of our method and the results of our experiments. We will also discuss the potential of our method for improving the efficiency and scalability of LIG production for gas sensors and other applications.",
