      "value": "Overall direction and writing keynote for each section : \nI’ll give you overall direction and writing keynote for each section of table of contents. This content will serve as a reference guideline for what points should be emphasized as a whole and what content should be included for each section in the table of contents. However, it should be noted that this content should not be included only, and the content should be specified and added around this content.\n\n(1) Overall Direction :\n\n- Keyword of our business plan is Talent transformation. Our business aims to function as a platform that leads the talent transformation of industrial talent. It is a platform that is involved in all directions, from selection and competency prediction for talent development, actual training and efficient operation, to evaluation and expansion into the recruitment market.\n- Udacity has given definitions for 'talent transformation'. Refer to Udacity's definition, business introduction and roadmap, business structure.\n\n(2) Writing Keynote for each Section (According to the order of contents organized in the above ‘format output’ part) :\n\\*Suppose that this part is feedbacks you’ve given from your upper manager, thus, this content should be well reflected in the final product. Contents that start with '-' under each section are keynote contents that you should refer to. Some sections may not have separate keynotes.\n\n1-a-i) background and problem\n\n- The background largely focused on three things below. Era change, that is, the trend that the 4th industrial revolution and AI era is coming, and secondly, the need for a change in the workforce. As the industry changes, new competencies are also required for the labor force, and the current speed of manpower training and supply is not keeping up with the changes of the times. In addition, companies do not have sufficient responsiveness to perform digital transformation in line with the trend of the times.\n\n1-a-ii) definition and product type (Structure of Talent Transformation)\n\n- Need for a structure of what Talent Transformation is, what needs to be met for successful talent transformation, and what fundamental, core technology and skills are required required in education and talent market regarding talent transformation. (definition and achivement requirements for Talent Transformation)\n- Suggest me clear definition for 'talent transformation' and fundamental technology needed. Refer to Udacity’s details regarding different levels of features and technology required in talent transformation process.\n- As we’ve classified, the types and stages of our business are following :\n(1) competency analysis of talent through DT(digital transformation) competency prediction\n(2)-1 Personalized education according to the required capabilities in digital transformation era (Reskilling & Upskilling), Big data based education curriculum recommendation system\n(2)-2 On-site competency improvement training such as PBL(project-based learning), Transforming Education and Operations innovative with Generative AI\n(3) Competency evaluation model using student big data\n- Our team believes that talent transformation requires understanding of technology, data, education domains, and the recruitment market. After Talent Transformation, it should also be linked to changes in the capabilities of corporate employees. Here are the elements we built up first:\n(1) need to understand the recruitment market (Skills that market needs)\n(2) Modeling the market's required capabilities and headcount measurements (status analysis system for organizations/individuals)\n(3) finally lead to \\*\\*\\*\\*good education\n- Accordingly, the structure defined in this part may need to be presented at a higher level, such as data and educational operation.\n\n1-b-i) Strength and complementary point\n- Strength : Student data, personalized education curriculum based on 4,050 varieties of modularized contents, Education Operational Efficiency based on modularization and use of generative AI\n- complementary point : Rather than a simple weakness, we need to supplement points that lead to our future roadmap. You, BusinessPlanExpert should help ideation about this part, how can we write complementary point as attractive and visionary. Since we refer a lot to the path that Udacity has walked, please refer to it and suggest what we don't have yet, and show it as a roadmap appropriately. Based on the presented information, define the steps to achieve Talent Transformation, refer to our company's strengths, divide what our company has achieved so far and what has not yet reached the level of Udacity, and also create a roadmap in the form of a table.\n\n1-b-ii) core technology\n\n- Here's what we've done so far:\n 1. DT selection competency evaluation technology\n 2. Personalized content recommendation technology\n 3. Competency evaluation model using student data\n 4. Operational efficiency\n Elaborate each points in detail, and suggest several more elements needed as core technology of talent transformation, regarding context of our business.\n\n1-c) Product/service development content and process\n\n- Three elements were presented in previous ideation : student admission model, data accumulation by funnel, B2B expansion and linkage.\nStudent admission model is development of a learning suitability + employment suitability evaluation model that is the basis for competency evaluation.\nWe’ve Collected qualitative cumulative experience data of students through the entire training funnel in bootcamp, and secured corporate data and conducted digital transformation training through B2B business.\n- Refer to this content, but the layer of information should be raised to upper hierarchy. For more higher concept, refer to Udacity’s business/product roadmap information.\n\n1-d) Revenue model, etc.\n\n- Need to make it clear and simple, revenue model should target B2B business, leverage what we’re doing now (B2C business of mass education via KDT) to business model that sells to companies, referring the aforementioned admission/prediction, training operation, and competency evaluation.\n\n2-a) Market size\n\n- We are targeting global market size, because the scale of intensive job transition training covered by our company is already on a global scale, and we have enough capacity to cover global talent transformation.\n- Need top-down valuation and bottom-up valuation. As top-down valuation of market size, give me total global adult Education Market + Job Market. As bottom-up valuation, give me required number of new workforce needed to achieve digital transformation, multiply by the average cost per person for digital transformation. Please show the calculation formula as it is.\n\n2-b-i) Status, pros and cons of other players in the market\n\n- Not only global educational platforms, but also include global businesses that could be classified as Talent development/talent incubation market. For example, career transformation platform like LinkedIn may also be included in this requirement. Summarize each company's classification, core characteristics, strengths, innovative technologies, and limitations in a table view\n\n2-b-ii) competitive advantage of Codestates\n\n- Codestates has a competitive edge with unique resources such as long-term training operation know-how and cumulative experience data of students to nurture digital industrial manpower\n- Other players in the market offer similar training and education programs, with much more limited scale and funnels.\n- Global scale bootcamp and amount of data\n\n2-c) Product/service recognition\n\n- Possess the overwhelming number 1 brand in the bootcamp market\n- Service awareness of individual/corporate customers\n- In the case of B2C bootcamp education, adult students from many countries are already receiving our education.\n\n2-d) Marketing and sales plan, etc.\n\n- Bring a global marketing framework (+reference link) that is most suitable for our product/business, and present the global expansion direction and marketing plan according to the framework.\n\n3-a-i) Differentiation and excellence compared to competing products/services\n\n- Holds a lot of student-based data\n- Content with personalized recommendations\n- Operational Efficiency\n\n3-a-ii) Service scalability\n\n- Right now, we are targeting Udacity, but it will become a talent incubation platform beyond LinkedIn. In the end, the important thing in Talent Transformation is the amount of human data. In the future, we believe that companies with educational human data will have an advantage in pursuing a platform, and we believe that we have competitiveness to expand in that respect.\n\n3-b) Technology level and price and quality competitiveness with domestic and foreign competitors' products/services\n\n- Define the latest technology trends related to education and human resources and the technology required for talent transformation → If the core of the technology is related to data, describe this content by connecting our strengths and characteristics from a data perspective.\n\n3-c) Countermeasures against competitor imitation\n\n- The importance of having your own data\n- we have the largest number of students and accumulating the most diverse and diverse experience data through long-term bootcamp training",
