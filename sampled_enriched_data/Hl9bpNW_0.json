Week 3: Open guard\n* Spend this week focusing on the open guard, where your legs are not locked around your opponent's body.\n* Practice using the open guard to sweep your opponent and take the top position.\n* Work on attacking from the open guard with submissions, such as the omoplata and arm triangle.\n4. Week 4: Butterfly guard\n* In this week, focus on mastering the butterfly guard, where you have a hook on your opponent's leg with your feet.\n* Practice using the butterfly guard to sweep your opponent and take the top position.\n* Work on attacking from the butterfly guard with submissions, such as the armbar and guillotine choke.\n5.
