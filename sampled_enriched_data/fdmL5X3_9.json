For example, one stone could have the power to heal or restore the land, another could grant its wielder immense magical power, and another could allow communication across great distances. These stones could be scattered throughout the world, hidden away in remote locations, or guarded by powerful beings or societies.\n\nThe main characters of the story could be on a quest to find and unite the World Stones, to harness their power and restore the world to its former glory. Alternatively, they could be protecting the stones from those who seek to misuse their power or use them for evil purposes.\n\nAs the story progresses, the characters could discover more about the origin and purpose of the World Stones, and the true nature of the cataclysmic event that destroyed half the world. This could lead to new revelations and challenges, as well as potential conflicts with other societies or individuals who have their own agendas for the World Stones.\n\nOverall, incorporating the World Stones into the story adds an exciting element of mystery and discovery, and creates a powerful driving force for the characters' actions and motivations.",

They've stood strong and sturdy. But our story opens with a moderate sized isles, perhaps a few miles across, sudden collapses. The first scenes are of the populace scrambling to safety aboard airships and others trying to escape across Aire Trams which are a system of suspended gondolas that act as the heavy lift transport for goods and materials and as a slower, lower cost form of transport for passengers. Of course, those who try to escape on the Trams are lost when the Isle collapses since the Tram lines attached to them collapse as well.",
