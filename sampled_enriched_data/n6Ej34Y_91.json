They are excited to see what has happened to him since their last visit, and they are eager to see if he is okay.\n\nAs they enter the apartment, they are greeted by the sight of Newman lying unconscious in the middle of the living room, surrounded by a large pool of hound dog smoothie. They are shocked and confused by what they see, and they are not sure what to do.\n\nKramer: *laughs* \"Wow, look at Newman. He's still unconscious in the middle of the living room. How funny is that?\"\n\nElaine: *laughs* \"Yeah, that is funny. I can't believe he's still unconscious. I wonder how long he's been like that.\"\n\nJerry: *laughs* \"Yeah, that is funny. I can't believe he's still unconscious. I wonder how long he's been like that. Maybe we should wake him up and see what happens.\"\n\nAnd with that, the gang starts to laugh and joke about the situation. They find it hilarious that Newman is still unconscious in the middle of the living room, and they find it hilarious that he is surrounded by a pool of hound dog smoothie. They find it hilarious that they can't seem to wake him up, no matter what they do.\n\nKramer: *laughs* \"Come on, Newman. Wake up and start flying again. Show us your Gloopernut magic.\"\n\nElaine: *laughs* \"Yeah, Newman. Wake up and show us your Gloopernut power. We're waiting.\"\n\nJerry: *laughs* \"Yeah, Newman. Wake up and fly again. Or not. Either way, it's funny.\"\n\nAnd with that, the gang continues to laugh and joke about the situation, not realizing that Newman is actually in danger. They don't realize that he is in need of medical attention, and they don't realize that he could die if they don't act quickly.\n\nBut as they continue to laugh and joke, they start to feel a sense of guilt and shame. They start to realize that they've done something wrong, and that they need to make things right. They start to realize that they need to be better friends and better people, and that they need to be more compassionate and more understanding.\n\nAnd with that, the gang stops laughing and smiling, and they start to feel a sense of responsibility and duty. They start to think about what they can do to help Newman, and they start to think about how they can make things right.\n\nAnd with that, the gang gathers around Newman and starts to try to wake him up. They call his name, they shake him gently, they try to give him water. They do everything they can to try to bring him back to consciousness.\n\nAnd after a few minutes of effort, they finally succeed. Newman wakes up and opens his eyes, looking around in confusion and shock.\n\nNewman: *groggily* \"What...what happened? Where am I? What's going on?\"\n\nKramer: *smiling* \"Hey, Newman. You're back. You're okay. You're in your apartment. You're safe.\"\n\nElaine: *smiling* \"Yeah, Newman. You're back. You're okay. You're in your apartment. You're safe.\"\n\nJerry: \\*",

He cries for all the pain and suffering he has experienced, and he cries for all the pain and suffering he has caused.\n\nBut as he cries, he starts to feel a sense of warmth and light. He starts to feel a sense of comfort and peace, and he starts to feel a sense of hope and happiness.
