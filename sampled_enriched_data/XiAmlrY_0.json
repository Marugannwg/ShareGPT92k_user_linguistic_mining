At that level, the 5% cut would represent more than 6,500 employees.\n\nDell is to lay off about 6,650 workers because of the decline in demand for personal computers.\n\nThe job cuts are expected to affect about 5% of its global workforce.\n\nThe company faced tough market conditions with an uncertain future and its previous cost-cutting measures were no longer enough, co-chief operating officer Jeff Clarke wrote in a memo.\n\nDell, based in Round Rock, Texas, announced similar lay-offs in 2020, after the pandemic hit.\n\nThe computing giant cited the \"challenging global economic environment\" for the cuts. In a letter to employees, Jeff Clarke, Dell's vice chairman, said steps the company has already taken - such as restrictions on employee travel and a pause on external hiring - are insufficient.\n\n\"What we know is market conditions continue to erode with an uncertain future,\" Clarke told employees. \"The steps we've taken to stay ahead of downturn impacts -- which enabled several strong quarters in a row -- are no longer enough. We now have to make additional decisions to prepare for the road ahead.\"\n\nThe move comes as layoffs continue to spread throughout the tech industry. Amazon, Microsoft, Google and others have each announced plans to cut thousands of workers as the companies adapt to shifting pandemic demand and fears of a looming recession.\n\nDell has also been grappling with reduced demand for personal computers.\n\nConsulting firm Gartner said last month that worldwide PC shipments fell more than 28% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period the prior year. This marked the largest quarterly shipment decline since Gartner began tracking the PC market in the mid-90s.\n\nDell, in particular, saw a 37% decline in PC vendor unit shipments during the final three months of 2022 compared to the year prior, according to Gartner.\n\nDell is to lay off about 6,650 workers because of the decline in demand for personal computers.\n\nThe job cuts are expected to affect about 5% of its global workforce.\n\nThe company faced tough market conditions with an uncertain future and its previous cost-cutting measures were no longer enough, co-chief operating officer Jeff Clarke wrote in a memo.\n\nDell, based in Round Rock, Texas, announced similar lay-offs in 2020, after the pandemic hit.\nThe latest department reorganisations and job cuts were an opportunity to drive efficiency, a company representative said.\n\n\"We continuously evaluate operations to ensure the right structure is in place to provide the best value and support to partners and customers.\n\n\"This is part of our regular course of business,\" a Dell spokesperson told the BBC.\nLay-offs in the US hit a more than two-year high in January, as the technology industry, once a reliable source of employment, cut jobs at the second-highest pace on record - to brace for a possible recession, a report showed on Thursday.\n\nCompanies including Google, Amazon and Meta are now grappling with how to balance cost-cutting measures with the need to remain competitive, as consumer and corporate spending shrinks amid high inflation and rising interest rates, after the pandemic.\n\nChief executive Mark Zuckerberg said recent job cuts had been \"the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history\", while Twitter cut about half its staff after multi-billionaire Elon Musk took control, in October.",

      "value": "The recent wave of layoffs in the tech industry has been attributed to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic uncertainty that has ensued. With global supply chains disrupted, consumer spending dwindling, and the shift towards remote work, companies have had to re-evaluate their operations and make tough decisions to cut costs.\n\nDell, like many other companies, has not been immune to these challenges. As the demand for personal computers declined, the company found itself with excess capacity and had to make the difficult decision to cut its workforce.\n\nThe layoffs will affect about 5% of Dell's global workforce, or roughly 6,650 employees. While the decision was a difficult one, Dell's co-chief operating officer Jeff Clarke explained in a memo that the company had to make additional cost-cutting measures to prepare for the future.\n\n\"What we know is market conditions continue to erode with an uncertain future,\" Clarke wrote. \"The steps we've taken to stay ahead of downturn impacts -- which enabled several strong quarters in a row -- are no longer enough. We now have to make additional decisions to prepare for the road ahead.\"\n\nDell's recent layoffs are not the first for the company. In 2020, the company also announced similar job cuts after the pandemic hit. However, the decline in demand for personal computers has continued, and the company had to take further steps to adjust to the changing market conditions.\n\nThe layoffs come as the tech industry as a whole is facing tough times. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have also announced plans to cut thousands of workers as they adapt to shifting pandemic demand and fears of a looming recession.\n\nWhile the layoffs are certainly tough for those affected, Dell has said that it's part of the company's regular course of business to evaluate operations and make adjustments where necessary.\n\n\"We continuously evaluate operations to ensure the right structure is in place to provide the best value and support to partners and customers,\" a Dell spokesperson told the BBC. \"This is part of our regular course of business.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also emphasized that the recent department reorganizations and job cuts were an opportunity to drive efficiency and create a leaner, more agile company that can better serve its customers.\n\nIn the end, the decision to cut jobs is never an easy one. However, for many companies in the tech industry, it has become a necessary step to remain competitive and weather the economic uncertainty that lies ahead. As we move forward, it will be interesting to see how companies like Dell continue to adapt and navigate the challenges of an ever-changing market.",
