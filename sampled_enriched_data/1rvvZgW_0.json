      "value": "I want to design a miniature robot with image sensing and in vitro navigation function. One end connects traction lines and wires. It is manipulated by humans to move its movement from the human mouth to the parts of the internal bile duct stones. The doll machine is trapped out of the body like a doll machine. In order to make this design more feasible, how should I design the shape and telescopic method before and after the four claws are expanded.",

      "value": "Designing a miniature robot for in vitro navigation with image sensing capabilities to remove internal bile duct stones is a fascinating and challenging project. To make this design more feasible, consider the following suggestions for the shape and telescopic mechanism of the robot's four claws:\n\n1. Shape:\n* The claws should be designed with a curved or hook-like shape to easily grasp and manipulate stones in the bile duct.\n* The tips of the claws should be rounded to minimize the risk of injury to the surrounding tissue.\n* The claws could be coated with a biocompatible material to reduce friction and ensure smooth movement within the bile duct.\n1. Telescopic mechanism:\n* Use a scissor-like mechanism that allows the claws to expand and retract. This would require each claw to have two hinged segments connected by a pivot point. As the claws are extended, the segments will move apart, allowing the claws to open.\n* Alternatively, use a central actuator, such as a motor or a shape-memory alloy (SMA) wire, to control the expansion and retraction of the claws. This would involve connecting the claws to the central actuator and programming the actuator to control the movement of the claws.\n* To minimize the size of the robot and ensure smooth navigation through the bile duct, design the claws to fold inwards when not in use. This will allow the robot to maintain a slim profile during insertion and removal.\n1. Image sensing:\n* Use a miniature camera, such as an endoscopic camera, to provide real-time visual feedback for the operator. This camera should be attached to the front of the robot, allowing the operator to see the environment and position the claws accordingly.\n* Ensure the camera is equipped with proper illumination, such as LED lights, to provide adequate visibility in the dark environment of the bile duct.\n1. Traction lines and wires:\n* Use flexible and durable materials for the traction lines and wires to withstand the forces applied during manipulation.\n* Ensure the wires are adequately insulated and protected to prevent damage during the procedure.\n1. Control system:\n* Develop a user-friendly control system that allows the operator to control the movement of the robot, including the expansion and retraction of the claws. This could involve a joystick or a haptic feedback system that provides tactile feedback to the operator as they manipulate the robot.\n\nBy considering these design aspects, you will be able to create a more feasible miniature robot for in vitro navigation and bile duct stone removal.",
