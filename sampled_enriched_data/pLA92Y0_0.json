Behavioural adaptations include mating rituals, like a male peacock bird showing his tail feathers to attract a female mate. They can also include working together in packs like wolves to hunt prey. Other animals have evolved the behavioural adaptation of using tools. For example, crocodiles use twigs to lure birds, who would pick them up to build nests.\n\nPhysiological adaptations in animals\nPhysiological adaptations of animals are processes which allow them to compete. The production of venom is an example of this. Many predators such as snakes and spiders produce venom both to defend themselves and kill their prey. When the cane toad was introduced into Australia, predators, such as native crocodiles and turtles, had not evolved to be resistant to its venom. Many ate cane toads and were killed.\n\nCondense into 3 bullet points",
