      "value": "In the European Union, the ownership and regulation of energy networks, both in the mainland and in small islands, are decentralized. Each EU member state is responsible for its own energy market, network ownership, and regulation while respecting the rules of the internal EU energy market and considering the EU's climate ambitions (URL 2).\n\nNational governments or private entities typically own the energy networks in each member state. Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) are responsible for managing the networks, ensuring the security of supply and grid stability. The specific ownership structure varies from country to country and may involve full or partial public ownership, private ownership, or a combination of both.\n\nEach member state has its own national energy regulatory authority responsible for overseeing the energy sector. These regulators ensure the proper functioning of the energy markets, protect consumer interests, and contribute to the development and implementation of EU energy policies.\n\nAt the European level, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) plays a crucial role in coordinating the work of national regulatory authorities, promoting market integration, and enhancing regulatory and technical cooperation between EU countries. ACER facilitates the development of EU-wide network codes and guidelines to harmonize the functioning of the internal energy market (URL 2).\n\nAs for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada, it does not directly regulate the ownership and operation of energy networks within the EU. However, the agreement aims to promote trade and investment in various sectors, including clean technologies and renewable energy, fostering innovation and cooperation between the EU and Canada (URL 2).\n\nURL 2: <https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/markets-and-consumers/action-and-measures-energy-prices_en>",

      "value": "Energy prices in the European Union are determined by a combination of factors such as supply and demand, production costs, taxes, and subsidies. Each EU country determines its own energy mix and pricing, while respecting the rules of the internal EU energy market and considering the EU's climate ambitions (URL 2).\n\nIn some countries, energy prices are regulated, with governments setting the prices for certain consumer groups, while in others, prices are determined by the free market. The specific regulatory framework for energy pricing may vary between the mainland and small islands, depending on the country and the unique challenges that islands face.\n\nSmall islands, including those within the EU, often have a different status and regulatory setup due to their unique energy needs and challenges. These islands tend to be more dependent on expensive fossil fuel imports for their energy needs, despite having access to renewable energy sources such as wind and wave energy (URL 2). The Clean Energy for EU Islands initiative, launched in 2017, aims to help islands transition to more sustainable and low-cost energy sources by providing a long-term framework for their clean energy transition (URL 3).\n\nIn some cases, small islands may have special provisions or support mechanisms in place to encourage the development and integration of renewable energy sources, improve energy efficiency, and reduce energy costs for consumers. This could involve, for example, different pricing structures or regulatory frameworks specifically tailored to address the unique challenges faced by small islands (URL 3).\n\nURL 2: <https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/markets-and-consumers/action-and-measures-energy-prices_en>\nURL 3: <https://smart-cities-marketplace.ec.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/2021/focus-eu-islands-and-clean-energy-transition>",
