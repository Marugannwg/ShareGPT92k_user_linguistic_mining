      "value": "As the old donkey stood in the corner of the barn, he couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over him. He had been a part of many birthday parties before, but there was always something unsettling about the \"Pin the Tail on the Donkey\" game.\n\nThe donkey had seen it all before. The giggling children, the spinning, the stumbling, and of course, the pinning. It all seemed like such a silly game to him, but he knew that it brought joy to the children and so he endured it with as much grace as he could muster.\n\nBut as the partygoers gathered around him, blindfolded and ready to play, the donkey couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Maybe it was the way the barn seemed to spin just a little bit faster today, or the way the air felt thicker and harder to breathe. Whatever it was, the donkey knew that this party was going to be different.\n\nAnd as the first child stepped up to play, the donkey braced himself for the worst. He felt the pin being placed in the child's hand, and he closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable. But as the seconds ticked by, nothing happened.\n\nThe donkey opened his eyes to see the child standing frozen in place, a look of confusion on their face. And as the other children gathered around, it became clear that something was wrong. The donkey looked down to see that his tail was already pinned to his rear end, a bright red ribbon tied neatly around the base.\n\nThe children gasped in shock, and the donkey couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over him. For once, the game had been won without him having to endure the painful pinching of his skin.\n\nAs the partygoers dispersed and the donkey was left alone in the barn, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected twist of events. It may have been a strange and confusing birthday party, but at least he had been spared the usual suffering. And as he settled into his bed of hay, the old donkey closed his eyes, feeling a sense of peace wash over him at last.",
