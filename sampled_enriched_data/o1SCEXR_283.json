      "value": "on the trigger point (move around very subtly and see if it’s more intense just to the side of where you currently are) or this may not be a trigger point you are dealing with. If the pain gets worse as you stay on it and then continues to get worse when you let go, it could be a muscle tear, bursitis (the result of an inflamed sac, called a bursa), or worse. As we said, this challenge is tricky and if you struggle with it, get some help in the beginning. Often, however, you are going to need a gadget—not just your hands—to release the trigger point, once you find it.\nGluteus maximus \nGluteus medius \nGluteus minimis Piriformis\n\nQuadratus lumborum \nFinding and Releasing Gluteal Trigger Points with Assistant Device\nLet’s assume that you have traced your trigger point to somewhere in your glutes, which is a very common area to find it, but you have not had any luck releasing it with your bare hands. You need help. Look at the next set of pictures. These folks are using a simple tennis ball, which does remarkably well. You try it. Jeremy will walk you through. \nStep 1: Okay, sit on the floor, and grab a tennis ball.\n\nStep 2: Place the tennis ball on the floor and slowly lower one side of your buttocks onto it, near where you think the trigger point lies. Try not to put your full weight onto it yet (it’ll hurt too much). \nStep 3: As always, brace your core. \nStep 4: Gently roll back and forth until you feel a surprisingly tender spot. That, we hope, is a trigger point. It is not uncommon for these spots to refer pain down the leg or into the low back, but stick with the most tender spot. \nStep 5: Once you find a sore spot, slowly lower your full body weight onto it if you can tolerate it. Breathe. \nStep 6: As you exhale, try to relax the muscles in your buttocks. Your body is not going to want to let you do this; your instinct is to tighten up because of the pain. Ignore your instincts, for once. \nStep 7: If you are directly on a trigger point, the pain will be great. But you will feel a slight lessening of the intensity of the pain in ten to thirty seconds. Remember to breathe and relax each time you exhale. And congratulations. You’ve done it. Started to, anyway; it’s going to take more than once, but you are there. When the pain eases, it is because you are literally releasing the spasm in the muscle. Nice. \nStep 8: If you don’t feel that lessening of pain, you might not be right on the trigger point. Roll around in very small circles (trigger points are no bigger than a dime) until you feel the most intense spot, and try again. \nStep 9: Slowly move around again until you feel another trigger point. Repeat the steps. \nStep 10: Some of you will notice that your chronic back pain is already noticeably diminished after doing this one time. That’s a great sign! But you’re not done. It does mean that your recovery is in sight. But you are going to have to do this more than once. And you’re going to have to follow the rest of the instructions in this book about the long-term exercise regimen. The immediate relief can be so great that you are tempted to say, “I’m done.” You are not done. \nLower Back Trigger Points\nSame story, but this time it’s for folks whose trigger points seem to be in the lower back. Okay, here’s Jeremy again.\n\nStep 1: You can do this lying on the floor or standing against a wall.\nStep 2: Place a tennis ball under you on the muscles of your lower back on either side of the spine. \nStep 3: Just as with the gluteal trigger points, gently roll around until you feel a very tender spot that may or may not radiate pain to another area. \nStep 4: Whether lying down or standing, gently put more of your body weight into the trigger point. \nStep 5: Use your breath to get this done. Try consciously to relax the muscle under the ball as you exhale. Doing this will allow you to get deeper into the muscle, targeting parts of the muscle you would not otherwise be able to reach. \nStep 6: You should feel a noticeable lessening of the pain in ten to thirty seconds. If you don’t, you may not be right on the trigger point. Roll around in very small circles (remember, trigger points are no bigger than a dime) until you feel the most intense spot, and try again. \nTROUBLESHOOTING FOR GLUTES AND LOWER BACK\nSee if any of the following complaints sound familiar. \n• “I can’t find any spots that hurt.” If after multiple attempts at covering every square centimeter of the muscles in the glutes or low back you cannot find a spot that hurts intensely, congratulations! You don’t have any trigger points. Move on to the next chapter.\n• “The pain gets much worse, not better, as I hold pressure on it.” If this occurs, one of two things is happening: You are on an area other than a trigger point or you aren’t in the center of the trigger point. If the pain rapidly increases in intensity and lingers for a while after you release the pressure, you could be hitting a nerve or bursa. Avoid that area and move on. If the pain stays the same or increases just a little bit, you may not be directly on the center of the trigger point. Move around millimeter by millimeter and see if you can get a release. \n• Again, some of you simply may not be able to do this. Go to a competent chiropractor or physical therapist and get a hand.",

      "value": "Section 6: Treatment of Trigger Points\n\nNow that we have discussed the causes, symptoms, and diagnosis of trigger points, it’s time to talk about the treatment options available. There are several methods used to treat trigger points, and a combination of these methods is often used for optimal results.\n\n1. Manual therapy: This type of therapy involves the use of hands-on techniques such as massage, stretching, and myofascial release to help loosen tight muscles and release trigger points. The therapist may apply pressure to the affected muscle to help release the knot and improve blood flow to the area. Manual therapy can be very effective in reducing pain and improving range of motion.\n2. Dry needling: This technique involves the insertion of thin needles into the affected muscle. The needle is inserted directly into the trigger point and may be moved around to help release the knot. Dry needling can be uncomfortable, but it is generally well-tolerated by patients. This technique can be very effective in reducing pain and muscle tension.\n3. Trigger point injections: In some cases, a healthcare provider may inject medication directly into the trigger point. This can help reduce pain and inflammation and improve range of motion. Trigger point injections are typically performed under local anesthesia.\n4. Physical therapy: Physical therapy may be recommended to help improve strength, flexibility, and range of motion. A physical therapist may use a combination of exercises, manual therapy, and other techniques to help reduce pain and improve function.\n5. Medications: Over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be recommended to help reduce pain and inflammation associated with trigger points. In some cases, a healthcare provider may prescribe muscle relaxants or other medications to help relieve muscle tension and pain.\n6. Lifestyle changes: Making certain lifestyle changes such as getting regular exercise, improving posture, and reducing stress can help reduce the frequency and severity of trigger points. In some cases, avoiding certain activities or positions may be necessary to prevent trigger points from developing.\n7. Alternative therapies: Some people find relief from trigger points through alternative therapies such as acupuncture, chiropractic, or herbal supplements. It’s important to talk with a healthcare provider before trying any alternative therapy to ensure it is safe and effective.\n\nIt’s important to note that not all treatment options are right for everyone. A healthcare provider can work with you to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs and preferences. With the right treatment, trigger points can be effectively managed, allowing you to live a more comfortable and active life.",
