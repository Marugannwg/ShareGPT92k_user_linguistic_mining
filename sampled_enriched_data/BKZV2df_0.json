      "value": "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. In classical computing, data is stored as bits, which can have a value of either 0 or 1. In quantum computing, data is stored as quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once. This allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. Some specific areas where quantum computing has the potential to make a big impact include cryptography, simulation, and optimization problems.",
