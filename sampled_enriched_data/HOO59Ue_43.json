Here's a modified version of your document, including the Hero's Journey structure:\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThis is a comprehensive introduction meant to bring you, the reader, up to speed with the current outline and motivations of the project.\n\nWhat is ‘The Journey’\n---------------------\n\nThe Journey, derived from The Hero’s Journey, is a theoretical roadmap to the development of the key elements that evoke powerful emotional reactions in people. The Hero’s Journey is a structure that has been followed by some of the greatest stories ever told and ever lived.\n\nThe version of this journey described throughout the document is tailored for Kadence and is meant to serve as a reference point and a workspace for ideas, planning, and the execution of specialized tactics in order to continuously develop and progress the story which underlies the public representation of the ideas covered in this document.\n\nThe Journey, its associated ambitions, milestones, challenges, and gimmicks are experimental in nature, and thus are used to further our own research into the business of artist development, and quite possible leaving our mark on the World.\n\nWhat is within this document?\n-----------------------------\n\nThis document contains a whole lot of useful information about characters, possible pathways of progression, theoretical understandings from The Hero’s Journey, and much more. Overall, this document is a collection of all types of information that is relevant to the project undertakings described above.\n\nHow should this document be used?\n---------------------------------\n\nThis document should be seen strictly as an experimental guideline line used to plan and execute experimental content and plot lines with the intent of learning from experiment results and making changes to procedures in the future where necessary. With regards to content, the content database provided in this document will be used to visualize the potential timeline of events that will transpire once the official process has gone underway (ie. when the first piece of planned content is released to the public and the timeline must be adhered to.)\n\nIn addition to the content calendar, the document will be the gathering place for information deemed useful during the planning and execution process of projects such as the [Docu-series: ‘Untitled’](https://www.notion.so/Docu-series-Untitled-16d8ab7a883946629fcfa3154b28f7f9). This information serves to fuel the end-user content that is scheduled and created. By using the Hero’s Journey as a guideline, maximum impact can be gradually attained via meticulous planning and execution of ordered story elements once it is distilled into its relevant parts here inside this document.\n\nWhat is [The Story]\n-------------------\n\n[The Story] is a character arch guideline for the [Docu-series: ‘Untitled’] that is derived from the content of this page. It occurs over a discrete time period, subtly growing in both complexity and depth. The point of using a story is simple, it allows us as the creators of content to understand what type of activities, emotions, themes, places, people, and other story elements to include in order to progress the story, in film format, from a clear beginning to a decisive end without relying on specific events or in real life occurrences that might be outside of our control. By determining the characters in the story, as well as their personalities, aspirations, fears, hopes, and desires, we will be able to translate the implied reality of those characters into practical actions and plot points that can be made in the real world to add a touch of fantasy-like takeaways to the project.\n\nBy taking the time to understand both the created characters and their real life counterparts, we ensure maximum compatibility with your (you reading",
