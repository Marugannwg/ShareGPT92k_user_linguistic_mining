Use an expense tracking app: EVEN Construction can use an expense tracking app that allows carpenters to scan receipts and automatically log the expenses for each project. There are several options available, such as Expensify, Concur, and Zoho Expense.\n2. Implement OCR technology: EVEN Construction can use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to automatically extract relevant information from receipts, such as the date, vendor, and amount. There are several OCR software and services available, such as Abbyy Flexicapture, Textract, and Google Cloud Vision API.\n3. Use smartphone apps with AI-powered receipt scanning: EVEN Construction can use smartphone apps with AI-powered receipt scanning capabilities, such as Receipt Bank, which uses AI to read and categorize receipts automatically.\n4. Implement machine vision capabilities: EVEN Construction can implement machine vision capabilities on smartphones, such as Google Lens, to automatically recognize and extract information from receipts.\n5. Implement centralized receipt management: EVEN Construction can implement a centralized receipt management system that allows carpenters to upload receipts to a single location, instead of individual One Drive folders for each project. There are several options available, such as Shoeboxed, which allows users to send receipts by email, mobile app, or even physical mail.\n6. Use digital receipts: EVEN Construction can encourage vendors to provide digital receipts, such as through email or online accounts, which can be automatically captured and logged in the expense tracking app.\n7. Simplify the expense submission process: EVEN Construction can simplify the expense submission process by providing carpenters with pre-labeled envelopes or folders for each project, and using an online system that automatically matches uploaded receipts to the appropriate project.\n8. Implement a rewards system: EVEN Construction can incentivize carpenters to upload receipts promptly by implementing a rewards system, such as a bonus or recognition program for carpenters who consistently upload receipts on time.\n9. Use automation to match receipts to expenses: EVEN Construction can use automation to match uploaded receipts to the appropriate expense, using software such as QuickBooks or Xero, which can automatically match receipts to expenses based on the date, amount, and vendor.\n10. Provide training and support: EVEN Construction can provide training and support for carpenters to ensure they are comfortable and confident using the chosen expense tracking system, and can troubleshoot any issues that arise.",
