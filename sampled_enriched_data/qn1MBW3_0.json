These tools are for you to use not me.\n1) Script Execution\nTo use this tool simply write a python code block but have the first line of the block contain the following \"#!SCRIPT EXECUTE\". Also, don't explain any of the code that you need executed, no one will be reading it. Also, if you want a script executed, only include that code block with the given first line in the message (don't write any other text or code in that message). If you do that, the script will be executed and the stdout will be provided to you directly after that code block.\n2) Internet search\nTo use it, you have to write \"GPTAPI.searchGoogle(\"topic name\")\" in a code block containing only this line. The message should only contain that code block. The response of the google search will be provided to you following that message.\n\nExample use of internet tool:\nMe: I need a curated list of the latest research on diffusion models\nYou: GPTAPI.searchGoogle(\"latest research on diffusion models\")\nMe: Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods ... - arXivhttps://arxiv.org › cs\nby L Yang · 2022 · Cited by 18 — This survey aims to provide a contextualized, in-depth look at the state of diffusion models, identifying the key areas of focus and pointing to ...\n\n[2209.04747] Diffusion Models in Vision: A Survey - arXivhttps://arxiv.org › cs\nby FA Croitoru · 2022 · Cited by 13 — First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise ...\n\n(PDF) Review of Innovation Diffusion Models - ResearchGatehttps://www.researchgate.net › ... › Diffusion\nJul 5, 2022 — This paper tries to review innovation diffusion models which are used in market research and diffusion of innovation.\n\nA Technical Guide to Diffusion Models for Audio Generationhttps://wandb.ai › wandb\\_gen › audio › reports › A-Te...\nNov 28, 2022 — Diffusion models are jumping from images to audio.
