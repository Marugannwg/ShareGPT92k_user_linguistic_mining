The developer logs in to [name of your project] and creates a new project.\n2. The developer enters the entities and relationships for their web application into the project setup form.\n3. [name of your project] generates the necessary REST APIs, database models, controllers, and routes files for the developer's web application.\n4. The developer downloads the code and begins working on the front-end of their web application.\n\nSuccessful outcome: The developer has a fully functional back-end for their web application and is able to begin building the front-end.\n\nTitle: Modifying an existing web application\n\nPrimary actor: Developer\n\nGoal: To use [name of your project] to make changes to the back-end of an existing web application built using the MERN stack.\n\nPreconditions:\n\n* The developer has access to [name of your project] and has an account.\n* The developer has an existing web application built using the MERN stack.\n\nTriggers: The developer wants to make changes to the back-end of their existing web application.\n\nScenarios:\n\n1. The developer logs in to [name of your project] and opens their existing project.\n2. The developer makes the necessary changes to the back-end of their web application using [name of your project].\n3. The developer downloads the updated code and begins testing the changes.\n\nSuccessful outcome: The developer has successfully modified the back-end of their web application and is able to test the changes.\n\nTitle: Setting up roles and authorization\n\nPrimary actor: Developer\n\nGoal: To use [name of your project] to set up roles and apply authorization to different routes in a web application.\n\nPreconditions:\n\n* The developer has access to [name of your project] and has an account.\n* The developer has a web application with multiple user levels or restricted access to certain features.\n\nTriggers: The developer wants to set up roles and apply authorization to different routes in their web application.\n\nScenarios:\n\n1. The developer logs in to [name of your project] and opens their existing project.\n2. The developer defines the different roles and permissions for their web application in [name of your project].\n3. The developer applies the appropriate authorization to different routes in their web application using [name of your project].\n4. The developer downloads the updated code and begins testing the authorization implementation.\n\nSuccessful outcome: The developer has successfully set up roles and applied authorization to different routes in their web application, ensuring that only certain users have access to certain features.\n\nI hope these examples give you a better idea of how your software might be used in practice in a more formal structure. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification.",

The main goal of [name of your project] is to streamline the setup and configuration process, making it faster and easier for developers to build professional-grade web apps. In addition to generating the necessary back-end code for web applications, [name of your project] also includes a code generator that creates a client-side boilerplate codebase for web apps, with customizable options such as styling strategy and the inclusion of Redux. Other key features of [name of your project] include project management, role and authorization management, and the ability to download and work on code locally. Overall, [name of your project] is a valuable resource for developers of all skill levels who want to build full-stack web applications using the MERN stack more efficiently and effectively.",
