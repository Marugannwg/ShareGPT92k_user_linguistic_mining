A progress payment building contract is a contract under which a person undertakes to carry out construction work or supply related goods and services for another person. A progress payment claim can be served by a person who claims to be entitled to a progress payment, on the person who is or may be liable to make the payment under the construction contract. The progress payment claim must identify the construction work or related goods and services, indicate the claimed amount, and state that it is made under the Act. The progress payment clause is an essential provision in the contract that outlines the payment terms and conditions. To make a progress payment claim, the claimant must serve the payment claim within the contractually agreed period or within 12 months after the last construction work or related goods and services were supplied. The claimant may serve only one payment claim per named month, but they can include multiple progress payments or claim for work done in previous named months. A head contractor must provide a supporting statement to the principal when serving a payment claim.",
