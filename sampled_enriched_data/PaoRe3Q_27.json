      "value": "Comparative is an innovative analytics solution that simplifies and modernizes data analysis for businesses. With Comparative, any employee can perform analysis across all company data, make informed decisions faster, and answer key business questions 10x faster, at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional BI tools. The solution removes 99% of the noise from data and automatically surfaces important factors driving changes in key metrics. It features a single, dynamic dashboard that allows users to drill down into any key metric and explore the entire dataset with just a few clicks, no technical expertise required. The advanced proprietary algorithm and lightning cache provide answers to critical business questions in seconds.\nPAIN POINTS: Finding answers to key business questions requires a team of analysts creating dashboards and writing queries - a complex, slow process even with modern BI tools. It is only getting harder as the amount of data a company can store is growing exponentially. Analytics remains unecessarily complex and requires expertise. Any employee can't get the answers they need quickly to make fast data driven decisions. Small businesses lack the budget and resources to do analysis well and support all of the business teams with timely answers.\nThe job titles that your company, Comparative, is targeting are Founder, President, Co-Founder, and C-level positions.\nThe key performance indicators (KPIs) that these job titles need to understand include Gross Booking Value, Number of bookings/reservations, daily active users vs. number of active clients, Conversion rate, average booking value, and customer satisfaction.\nChallenges of each buyer: Maximize Growth & Profitability - Quickly understand what is impacting top line business metrics and make more informed decisions that maximize company growth. Empower departments to collaborate and make immediate business decisions\nAgain, I'm providing information about my company Comparative. DO NOT WRITE emails until I say \"GO\".
