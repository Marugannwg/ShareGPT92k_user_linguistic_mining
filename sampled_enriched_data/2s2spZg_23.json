By building an online presence, you can reach a wider audience and gather feedback from potential customers, which will help you validate your business idea and fine-tune your offerings.\n\nOnce you have a solid online presence and a sizable audience, you can start testing your business idea by offering a small sauna service. This will allow you to gather more feedback and data on the demand for your services, as well as test your pricing, marketing and operations.\n\nBy starting small, you can test the market and validate your business idea before committing significant resources to the venture. You can then use the feedback and data you gather to make informed decisions about how to proceed with your spa and wellness center business.\n\nIt's also important to note that, as you build your online presence and grow your audience, you can start promoting your sauna service and gathering pre-booking, this will help you gauge the level of interest and demand for your services, and can also help you secure initial revenue and build a customer base for your future spa and wellness center.\n\nAs you progress, you can continue to build and diversify your online presence by adding more services and products, such as cold shower and massage, this will help you increase your revenue streams and build a sustainable business.",
