      "value": "In the fictional magical system you described, it is possible that a mage could use the correspondance sphere in conjunction with the life and matter spheres to find the body of someone somewhere on the planet and then resurrect them. The correspondance sphere deals with patterns of connection and distance, and allows mages to manipulate and alter these patterns in various ways, including divination and teleportation. The life sphere deals with patterns of growth and evolution, and allows mages to manipulate and alter these patterns in various ways, including resurrection. The matter sphere deals with patterns of inorganic, non-living matter, and allows mages to manipulate and alter these patterns in various ways.\n\nTo find the body of someone somewhere on the planet, a mage would likely need to reach at least level 3 of mastery in the correspondance sphere. At this level, a mage would be able to control distance and space and use it to damage themselves or others. This level of mastery would allow the mage to perform more complex and powerful magic related to correspondance, including the ability to divine or locate objects or people over long distances.\n\nTo resurrect someone, a mage would likely need to reach at least level 3 of mastery in the life sphere. At this level, a mage would be able to control patterns of growth and evolution and use them to damage themselves or others. This level of mastery would allow the mage to perform more complex and powerful magic related to life, including the ability to bring someone back to life.\n\nThe matter sphere would also likely be involved in the resurrection process, as the mage would need to manipulate the physical body of the person being resurrected. The specific level of mastery needed in the matter sphere would depend on the condition of the body and the complexity of the resurrection process.\n\nTo combine these effects and find the body of someone somewhere on the planet and then resurrect them, the mage would need to use a combination of correspondance, life, and matter magic. The specific level of mastery needed to successfully perform this type of magic would depend on the complexity of the spell and the resistance of the subject.",
