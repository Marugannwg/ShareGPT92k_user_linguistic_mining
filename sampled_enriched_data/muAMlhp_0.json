BANK - DAY]\n\nJoker, Chris, Michael, and Waingro, all wearing clown masks, storm into the bank. Waingro waves his gun in the air, while Chris and Michael take out the security guards. The Joker calmly walks to the counter, a wide grin painted on his mask.\n\nJoker: (smiling) Ladies and gentlemen, today's your lucky day! We're here for your money, not your lives... unless, of course, you try to be a hero. So, let's make this quick and easy, shall we?\n\nThe bank employees and customers cower as the robbers begin their heist. Chris and Michael start collecting money from the cashiers, while Waingro watches the hostages.\n\n[EXT. BANK - DAY]\n\nLt. Vincent Hanna, a seasoned detective, is parked outside the bank, watching the scene unfold.\n\nLt. Hanna: (into radio) We've got a 211 in progress. Suspects are heavily armed and wearing clown masks. Requesting backup immediately.\n\n[INT. BANK - DAY]\n\nAs the Joker cracks open the vault, he looks around to make sure no one is watching.\n\nJoker: (whispering to himself) Why so serious? Let's put a smile on this vault.\n\nThe Joker uses a small explosive device to blow the vault door open. They gather the money and stuff it into large duffel bags.\n\nJoker: (to his crew) Time to go, boys. We've got a city to paint with chaos.\n\n[EXT. BANK - DAY]\n\nThe robbers exit the bank, duffel bags in hand, just as the police arrive. The Joker, Chris, and Michael get into their getaway car, while Waingro starts shooting at the police, causing panic.\n\nJoker: (irritated) Waingro, you trigger-happy fool! Get in the car!\n\nWaingro reluctantly stops shooting and jumps into the car.\n\n[INT. GETAWAY CAR - DAY]\n\nAs they speed away from the bank, Joker removes his mask and tosses it aside.\n\nJoker: (to Chris, while laughing manically) We did it, boys! Now, let's see if our dear Lieutenant can keep up with us.\n\nThe Joker leans out the window and fires a few shots at the pursuing police cars, causing them to swerve.\n\n[EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY]\n\nA high-speed chase ensues, with the robbers weaving in and out of traffic, narrowly avoiding collisions. Lt. Hanna, determined not to lose them, stays hot on their tail.\n\n[INT. GETAWAY CAR - DAY]\n\nJoker: (grinning) Time for a little diversion. Chris, take the wheel.\n\nThe Joker pulls out a remote control and presses a button, detonating a pre-planted explosion at a nearby construction site. The blast sends debris flying everywhere, creating chaos and blocking the police's path.\n\n[EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY]\n\nWith the police temporarily halted, the robbers make their escape, disappearing into the city.\n\n[INT. LT. HANNA'S CAR - DAY]\n\nLt. Hanna slams his fists on the steering wheel in frustration.\n\nLt. Hanna: (to himself) I'll get you, Joker. This isn't over.\n\nFADE OUT.",
