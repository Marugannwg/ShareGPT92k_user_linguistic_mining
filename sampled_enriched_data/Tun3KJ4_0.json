      "value": "The following is the continuation of the chapter. Summarize this as well:\n\nvirtual reality and 3D interaction\npositioning in 3D space\nmoving and grasping\nseeing 3D (helmets and caves)\npositioning in 3D space\n• cockpit and virtual controls\n– steering wheels, knobs and dials … just like real!\n• the 3D mouse\n– six-degrees of movement: x, y, z + roll, pitch, yaw\n• data glove\n– fibre optics used to detect finger position\n• VR helmets\n– detect head motion and possibly eye gaze\n• whole body tracking\n– accelerometers strapped to limbs or reflective dots\nand video processing\npitch, yaw and roll\npitch\nyaw\nroll\n3D displays\n• desktop VR\n– ordinary screen, mouse or keyboard control\n– perspective and motion give 3D effect\n• seeing in 3D\n– use stereoscopic vision\n– VR helmets\n– screen plus shuttered specs, etc.\nalso see extra slides on 3D vision\nVR headsets\n• small TV screen for each eye\n• slightly different angles\n• 3D effect\nVR motion sickness\n• time delay\n– move head … lag … display moves\n– conflict: head movement vs. eyes\n• depth perception\n– headset gives different stereo distance\n– but all focused in same plane\n– conflict: eye angle vs. focus\n• conflicting cues => sickness\n– helps motivate improvements in technology\nsimulators and VR caves\n• scenes projected on walls\n• realistic environment\n• hydraulic rams!\n• real controls\n• other people\nphysical controls, sensors etc.\nspecial displays and gauges\nsound, touch, feel, smell\nphysical controls\nenvironmental and bio-sensing\ndedicated displays\n• analogue representations:\n– dials, gauges, lights, etc.\n• digital displays:\n– small LCD screens, LED lights, etc.\n• head-up displays\n– found in aircraft cockpits\n– show most important controls\n… depending on context\nSounds\n• beeps, bongs, clonks, whistles and\nwhirrs\n• used for error indications\n• confirmation of actions e.g. keyclick\nalso see chapter 10\nTouch, feel, smell\n• touch and feeling important\n– in games … vibration, force feedback\n– in simulation … feel of surgical instruments\n– called haptic devices\n• texture, smell, taste\n– current technology very limited\nBMW iDrive\n• for controlling menus\n• feel small ‘bumps’ for each item\n• makes it easier to select options by feel\n• uses haptic technology from Immersion Corp.\nphysical controls\n• specialist controls needed …\n– industrial controls, consumer products, etc.\nlarge buttons\nclear dials\ntiny buttons\nmulti-function\ncontrol\neasy-clean\nsmooth buttons\nEnvironment and bio-sensing\n• sensors all around us\n– car courtesy light – small switch on door\n– ultrasound detectors – security, washbasins\n– RFID security tags in shops\n– temperature, weight, location\n• … and even our own bodies …\n– iris scanners, body temperature, heart rate,\ngalvanic skin response, blink rate\npaper: printing and scanning\nprint technology\nfonts, page description, WYSIWYG\nscanning, OCR\nPrinting\n• image made from small dots\n– allows any character set or graphic to be\nprinted,\n• critical features:\n– resolution\n• size and spacing of the dots\n• measured in dots per inch (dpi)\n– speed\n• usually measured in pages per minute\n– cost!!\nTypes of dot-based printers\n• dot-matrix printers\n– use inked ribbon (like a typewriter\n– line of pins that can strike the ribbon, dotting the paper.\n– typical resolution 80-120 dpi\n• ink-jet and bubble-jet printers\n– tiny blobs of ink sent from print head to paper\n– typically 300 dpi or better .\n• laser printer\n– like photocopier: dots of electrostatic charge deposited on\ndrum, which picks up toner (black powder form of ink)\nrolled onto paper which is then fixed with heat\n– typically 600 dpi or better.\nPrinting in the workplace\n• shop tills\n– dot matrix\n– same print head used for several paper rolls\n– may also print cheques\n• thermal printers\n– special heat-sensitive paper\n– paper heated by pins makes a dot\n– poor quality, but simple & low maintenance\n– used in some fax machines\nFonts\n• Font – the particular style of text\nCourier font\nHelvetica font\nPalatino font\nTimes Roman font\n• ♣×∝≡↵ℜ€⊗↵~€ (special symbol)\n• Size of a font measured in points (1 pt about 1/72”)\n(vaguely) related to its height\nThis is ten point Helvetica\nThis is twelve point\nThis is fourteen point\nThis is eighteen point\nand this is twenty-four point\nFonts (ctd)\nPitch\n– fixed-pitch – every character has the same width\ne.g. Courier\n– variable-pitched – some characters wider\ne.g. Times Roman – compare the ‘i’ and the “m”\nSerif or Sans-serif\n– sans-serif – square-ended strokes\ne.g. Helvetica\n– serif – with splayed ends (such as)\ne.g. Times Roman or Palatino\nReadability of text\n• lowercase\n– easy to read shape of words\n• UPPERCASE\n– better for individual letters and non-words\ne.g. flight numbers: BA793 vs. ba793\n• serif fonts\n– helps your eye on long lines of printed text\n– but sans serif often better on screen\nPage Description Languages\n• Pages very complex\n– different fonts, bitmaps, lines, digitised photos, etc.\n• Can convert it all into a bitmap and send to the printer\n… but often huge !\n• Alternatively Use a page description language\n– sends a description of the page can be sent,\n– instructions for curves, lines, text in different styles, etc.\n– like a programming language for printing!\n• PostScript is the most common\nScreen and page\n• WYSIWYG\n– what you see is what you get\n– aim of word processing, etc.\n• but …\n– screen: 72 dpi, landscape image\n– print: 600+ dpi, portrait\n• can try to make them similar\nbut never quite the same\n• so … need different designs, graphics etc, for\nscreen and print\nScanners\n• Take paper and convert it into a bitmap\n• Two sorts of scanner\n– flat-bed: paper placed on a glass plate, whole page\nconverted into bitmap\n– hand-held: scanner passed over paper, digitising strip\ntypically 3-4” wide\n• Shines light at paper and note intensity of reflection\n– colour or greyscale\n• Typical resolutions from 600–2400 dpi\nScanners (ctd)\nUsed in\n– desktop publishing for incorporating\nphotographs and other images\n– document storage and retrieval systems,\ndoing away with paper storage\n+ special scanners for slides and photographic\nnegatives\nOptical character recognition\n• OCR converts bitmap back into text\n• different fonts\n– create problems for simple “template\nmatching” algorithms\n– more complex systems segment text,\ndecompose it into lines and arcs, and\ndecipher characters that way\n• page format\n– columns, pictures, headers and footers\nPaper-based interaction\n• paper usually regarded as output only\n• can be input too – OCR, scanning, etc.\n• Xerox PaperWorks\n– glyphs – small patterns of /\\\\//\\\\\\\n• used to identify forms etc.\n• used with scanner and fax to control applications\n• more recently\n– papers micro printed - like wattermarks\n• identify which sheet and where you are\n– special ‘pen’ can read locations\n• know where they are writing\nmemory\nshort term and long term\nspeed, capacity, compression\nformats, access\nShort-term Memory - RAM\n• Random access memory (RAM)\n– on silicon chips\n– 100 nano-second access time\n– usually volatile (lose information if power turned off)\n– data transferred at around 100 Mbytes/sec\n• Some non-volatile RAM used to store basic\nset-up information\n• Typical desktop computers:\n64 to 256 Mbytes RAM\nLong-term Memory - disks\n• magnetic disks\n– floppy disks store around 1.4 Mbytes\n– hard disks typically 40 Gbytes to 100s of Gbytes\naccess time ~10ms, transfer rate 100kbytes/s\n• optical disks\n– use lasers to read and sometimes write\n– more robust that magnetic media\n– CD-ROM\n- same technology as home audio, ~ 600 Gbytes\n– DVD - for AV applications, or very large files\nBlurring boundaries\n• PDAs\n– often use RAM for their main memory\n• Flash-Memory\n– used in PDAs, cameras etc.\n– silicon based but persistent\n– plug-in USB devices for data transfer\nspeed and capacity\n• what do the numbers mean?\n• some sizes (all uncompressed) …\n– this book, text only ~ 320,000 words, 2Mb\n– the Bible ~ 4.5 Mbytes\n– scanned page ~ 128 Mbytes\n• (11x8 inches, 1200 dpi, 8bit greyscale)\n– digital photo ~ 10 Mbytes\n• (2–4 mega pixels, 24 bit colour)\n– video ~ 10 Mbytes per second\n• (512x512, 12 bit colour, 25 frames per sec)\nvirtual memory\n• Problem:\n– running lots of programs + each program large\n– not enough RAM\n• Solution - Virtual memory :\n– store some programs temporarily on disk\n– makes RAM appear bigger\n• But … swopping\n– program on disk needs to run again\n– copied from disk to RAM\n– s l o w s t h i n g s d o w n\nCompression\n• reduce amount of storage required\n• lossless\n– recover exact text or image – e.g. GIF, ZIP\n– look for commonalities:\n• text: AAAAAAAAAABBBBBCCCCCCCC 10A5B8C\n• video: compare successive frames and store change\n• lossy\n– recover something like original – e.g. JPEG, MP3\n– exploit perception\n• JPEG: lose rapid changes and some colour\n• MP3: reduce accuracy of drowned out notes\nStorage formats - text\n• ASCII - 7-bit binary code for to each letter and\ncharacter\n• UTF-8 - 8-bit encoding of 16 bit character set\n• RTF (rich text format)\n- text plus formatting and layout information\n• SGML (standardized generalised markup language)\n- documents regarded as structured objects\n• XML (extended markup language)\n- simpler version of SGML for web applications\nStorage formats - media\n• Images:\n– many storage formats :\n(PostScript, GIFF, JPEG, TIFF, PICT, etc.)\n– plus different compression techniques\n(to reduce their storage requirements)\n• Audio/Video\n– again lots of formats :\n(QuickTime, MPEG, WAV, etc.)\n– compression even more important\n– also ‘streaming’ formats for network delivery\nmethods of access\n• large information store\n– long time to search => use index\n– what you index -> what you can access\n• simple index needs exact match\n• forgiving systems:\n– Xerox “do what I mean” (DWIM)\n– SOUNDEX – McCloud ~ MacCleod\n• access without structure …\n– free text indexing (all the words in a document)\n– needs lots of space!!\nprocessing and networks\nfinite speed (but also Moore’s law)\nlimits of interaction\nnetworked computing\nFinite processing speed\n• Designers tend to assume fast processors, and make\ninterfaces more and more complicated\n• But problems occur, because processing cannot keep up\nwith all the tasks it needs to do\n– cursor overshooting because system has buffered\nkeypresses\n– icon wars - user clicks on icon, nothing happens, clicks on\nanother, then system responds and windows fly\neverywhere\n• Also problems if system is too fast - e.g. help screens\nmay scroll through text much too rapidly to be read\nMoore’s law\n• computers get faster and faster!\n• 1965 …\n– Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, noticed a pattern\n– processor speed doubles every 18 months\n– PC … 1987: 1.5 Mhz, 2002: 1.5 GHz\n• similar pattern for memory\n– but doubles every 12 months!!\n– hard disk … 1991: 20Mbyte : 2002: 30 Gbyte\n• baby born today\n– record all sound and vision\n– by 70 all life’s memories stored in a grain of dust!\n/e3/online/moores-law/\nthe myth of the infinitely\nfast machine\n• implicit assumption … no delays\nan infinitely fast machine\n• what is good design for real machines?\n• good example … the telephone :\n– type keys too fast\n– hear tones as numbers sent down the line\n– actually an accident of implementation\n– emulate in deisgn\nLimitations on interactive\nperformance\nComputation bound\n– Computation takes ages, causing frustration for the user\nStorage channel bound\n– Bottleneck in transference of data from disk to memory\nGraphics bound\n– Common bottleneck: updating displays requires a lot of\neffort - sometimes helped by adding a graphics\nco-processor optimised to take on the burden\nNetwork capacity\n– Many computers networked - shared resources and files,\naccess to printers etc. - but interactive performance can be\nreduced by slow network speed\nNetworked computing\nNetworks allow access to …\n– large memory and processing\n– other people (groupware, email)\n– shared resources – esp. the web\nIssues\n– network delays – slow feedback\n– conflicts - many people update data\n– unpredictability\nThe internet\n• history …\n– 1969: DARPANET US DoD, 4 sites\n– 1971: 23; 1984: 1000; 1989: 10000\n• common language (protocols):\n– TCP – Transmission Control protocol\n• lower level, packets (like letters) between machines\n– IP – Internet Protocol\n• reliable channel (like phone call) between programs on\nmachines\n– email, HTTP, all build on top of these",
