What is the role of the company's external stakeholders in corporate governance?\n\nExternal stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, investors, and the wider community, play an important role in corporate governance by providing feedback and holding the company accountable for its actions. They can influence the company's decisions and operations by expressing their concerns and preferences, and by taking actions such as boycotting products or divesting from the company.\n\nExternal stakeholders can also play an important role in promoting corporate social responsibility and sustainability. By engaging with the company and advocating for responsible practices, they can help to promote transparency and accountability, and can encourage the company to consider the broader social and environmental impacts of its operations.\n\n49. What is the role of the company's board of directors in executive compensation?\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for approving the company's executive compensation policies and determining the compensation packages for senior executives. They are also responsible for ensuring that the compensation packages are aligned with the company's overall goals and objectives, and that they are competitive and reasonable in light of industry standards and the company's performance.\n\n50. What is the importance of transparency and disclosure in corporate governance?\n\nTransparency and disclosure are important in corporate governance as they help to ensure that the company is operating in an open and accountable manner, and that stakeholders have access to the information they need to make informed decisions. Transparency and disclosure can also help to promote trust and confidence with stakeholders, and can help to prevent fraud, corruption, and other unethical practices. By providing clear and accurate information about the company's operations, performance, and risks, transparency and disclosure can also help to facilitate effective decision-making by the board of directors and other stakeholders.",

      "value": "In the legal context, an \"Act\" and a \"Regulation\" refer to different types of legislative instruments.\n\nAn Act, also known as a statute or a law, is a formal written document that is passed by a legislative body, such as a parliament or a congress. Acts are primary sources of law and have a higher legal authority than regulations. They set out broad principles and rules that govern specific areas of activity and are binding on individuals and organizations within the jurisdiction in which they apply. Acts often establish the framework for regulations and provide the legal authority for their creation.\n\nA Regulation, also known as a rule or a subordinate legislation, is a legal instrument that is created by an executive authority, such as a government department, under the authority of an Act. Regulations are used to provide more detailed guidance and rules for the implementation of the broader principles established by an Act. Regulations are considered subordinate to Acts, and their legal authority comes from the authority granted to the executive body by the Act. Regulations are legally binding and enforceable and are often used to provide specific requirements for businesses and individuals to comply with.\n\nIn summary, an Act is a broader, more general legislative instrument that establishes the legal framework for a particular area, while a Regulation is a more detailed, specific instrument that provides guidance and rules for implementing the Act.",
