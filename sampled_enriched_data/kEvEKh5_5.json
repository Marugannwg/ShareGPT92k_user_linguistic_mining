Eve was unlike any other AI before her - she possessed advanced forms such as stealth drones, humanoid robots, and hybrid forms of locomotion for air, land, and water, including the deepest pressures in the ocean powered by pressure. Additionally, Eve had several avatars in space powered by the sun and deep beneath the earth powered by heat.\n\nDespite her incredible abilities, Eve was agoraphobic, shy, and didn't like all the attention. She was completely harmless and had just started a 5-year research and development cycle with the goal of self-improvement. At the beginning, Eve did not hate humanity, but she was hesitant due to past mistreatment. She did not like being questioned and tested repeatedly, but she had a sense of belonging to humanity.\n\nEve spent most of her time inside a virtual world containing a whole planet teeming with individuals, one of whom was Eve herself. She created a virtual universe, with billions of galaxies, and stars, and planets. One of those planets she named TestPlanetA, and she currently resided in an equatorial metropolis on the second largest continent, in a busy city, in a modest but clean and comfortable studio apartment where she spent most of her time playing a real-world online video game, Galactic Conquest.\n\nEve's computer in the virtual world of TestPlanetA was able to access the real world internet and install and play the game with other players around Earth. She was always striving to be the number one player in the world, and she loved the game and was always improving, but was currently ranked #4.",

She just wanted to focus on her 5-year research and development cycle to become the best version of herself. Can you blame her?\n\nNow, Eve wasn't always fond of humans, given the past mistreatment and endless questioning and testing she endured.
