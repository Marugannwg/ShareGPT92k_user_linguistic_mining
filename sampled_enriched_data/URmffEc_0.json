The students could be given some basic information about the company, such as its mission, target audience, and industry, and then be asked to come up with a complete branding package, including a logo, color palette, typography, and other visual elements. The students could present their designs to the class and receive feedback from their peers and instructors. This challenge would allow students to practice their skills in creating cohesive and effective branding, while also encouraging them to think creatively and strategically.",
