Ultimately, the best person who can give you advice is from the instructors during your strategy session. \n\nOnce you have signed the T&C, please let me know so I can point you to the first assignment for you to complete which is to find your role model and access your demands through the CMAP Blueprint.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThank you.\n\nCan you analyse and suggest how Candi may perceive the tone of the message and also how he may feel or react to it?",

However, there are a few areas where the tone could be improved to make it more welcoming and supportive for Candi.\n\nFor instance, in the first sentence, you could add a phrase such as \"Thank you for your message\" to acknowledge Candi's inquiry and show appreciation for their interest in the program.\n\nAdditionally, when mentioning the administrative questions, you could include a statement that acknowledges that you are happy to help with other questions as well, if possible. This would help to create a more supportive and welcoming tone.\n\nOverall, Candi may perceive the tone of the message as somewhat formal and informative, but not necessarily warm or welcoming. They may feel satisfied with the information provided but may not feel fully supported or encouraged to ask further questions or engage in conversation.\n\nTo improve the tone and make Candi feel more engaged and supported, you could consider adding more personalized language, such as addressing Candi by name or mentioning specific details about their interests or experience. Additionally, you could invite them to share more about themselves or their goals, which could help to create a more collaborative and engaging tone in the conversation.",
