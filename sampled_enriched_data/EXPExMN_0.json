This could lead to an increase in economic activity, as more people and businesses are able to purchase vehicles, and ultimately boost the economy.\n\nOn the other hand, an increase in supply could also lead to an oversupply of vehicles, resulting in a decrease in the value of existing vehicles and a decline in the resale value of vehicles. This could be a negative effect for those who have recently purchased a vehicle and are looking to sell it in the near future.\n\nIt's also worth noting that an increase in the supply of COE would likely be accompanied by an increase in the number of vehicles on the road, which could exacerbate traffic congestion and contribute to air pollution.\n\nOverall, whether an increase in the supply of COE is considered \"good\" or not would depend on the specific circumstances and the balance of positive and negative effects.",
