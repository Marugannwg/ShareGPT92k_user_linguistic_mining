The cafe is bustling with activity, but she's focused on her work.\n\nSuddenly, a man, RYAN, approaches her table and clears his throat.\n\nRYAN: Excuse me, miss. Mind if I sit down?\n\nJessica looks up, startled, and hesitates for a moment before nodding.\n\nJESSICA: Uh, sure.\n\nRyan takes a seat across from her and smiles.\n\nRYAN: Thanks. I'm Ryan.\n\nJESSICA: Jessica.\n\nThey sit in silence for a moment, both of them unsure of what to say next.\n\nRYAN: So, what brings you to the coffee shop today?\n\nJessica hesitates before answering.\n\nJESSICA: Just trying to finish up some work.\n\nRYAN: Ah, I know the feeling. I'm actually a writer myself.\n\nJessica looks at Ryan with interest.\n\nJESSICA: Really? What do you write?\n\nRYAN: Mostly screenplays. I'm actually working on one right now.\n\nJessica's eyes light up.\n\nJESSICA: No way! I've always wanted to write a screenplay.\n\nRyan smiles.\n\nRYAN: Well, maybe I can help you out. I'm always looking for a writing partner.\n\nJessica's face lights up with excitement.\n\nJESSICA: That would be amazing! Thank you!\n\nRyan and Jessica spend the next few hours brainstorming ideas and working on the screenplay. As the sun begins to set, they pack up their things and prepare to leave.\n\nRYAN: Same time tomorrow?\n\nJESSICA: You bet.\n\nThey exchange a smile before parting ways, both of them excited to see where their collaboration will take them.",

This was a deliberate choice to focus on the internal conflict and character development of the two main characters, Jessica and Ryan.\n\nBy having the characters work on a screenplay together, the focus of the story shifts to their collaborative process, their personal journeys as writers, and the interpersonal dynamic between them. The conflict in the story lies in the internal struggles and doubts that the characters face as they work on their creative project and develop their relationship.\n\nWhile a clear external conflict or antagonist can add tension and drive a story forward, it is not always necessary for a story to be engaging and impactful. By emphasizing the emotional and intellectual journey of the characters, the screenplay can explore themes of creative inspiration, artistic process, and the power of collaboration.\n\nOf course, this is just one possible approach to storytelling, and different writers and filmmakers may choose to emphasize different elements in their work.",

Manchester by the Sea (2016) - This film follows Lee Chandler, a man who returns to his hometown to take care of his nephew after his brother's death.

By focusing on character development and internal conflict, these films create a deeper emotional connection with the audience and offer insights into the human experience.",
