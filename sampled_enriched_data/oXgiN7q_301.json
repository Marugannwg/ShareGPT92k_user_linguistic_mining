The mirror has been passed down through the centuries, and as people become enamored with the alternate future, it takes a toll on their present relationships and overall well-being. The story follows a series of characters who come into contact with the mirror and the impact it has on their lives.\n\nChapter 1: The Mirror's Arrival\n\nWe are introduced to the mirror in its past history in England many years before it was shipped off to America.\nThe mirror is boxed up and shipped to the United States.\nWe see it in a New York museum, and the employees discuss its history.\nChapter 2: The Teenager\n\nThe mirror is moved to a new location where a teenage boy is able to sit and stare at it for hours.\nThe boy becomes increasingly drawn to the alternate future the mirror shows him.\nChapter 3: The Married Woman\n\nThe mirror is sold to a married woman who lost her child.\nShe becomes consumed by the alternate future the mirror shows her.\nChapter 4: The Elderly Man\n\nThe mirror is inherited by an elderly man who lost his wife.\nHe becomes isolated and fixated on the alternate future the mirror shows him.\nChapter 5: Breaking Free\n\nThe mirror is broken or removed from each character's life, freeing them from the grip of the alternate future.\nThe characters are able to grieve the loss of the alternate future and begin living in the present.\nChapter 6: Moving On",
