      "value": "Open innovation is a concept that refers to the process of leveraging external resources, knowledge, and expertise to drive innovation within an organization. The traditional closed innovation model assumes that all the necessary resources and knowledge are available within the organization, but open innovation recognizes that there is often valuable knowledge and expertise outside the organization that can be leveraged to create new ideas, products, and services.\n\nThe tools of open innovation include various methods for collaborating with external stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, partners, and even competitors. Some of the common tools used in open innovation include crowdsourcing, open source software, innovation contests, and collaborative research and development programs.\n\nCrowdsourcing is a method of obtaining ideas or solutions from a large group of people, usually through an online platform. Open source software is a model for developing software where the source code is made publicly available for anyone to access and modify. Innovation contests are competitions where individuals or teams submit their ideas or solutions to a problem, and the best one is chosen as the winner. Collaborative research and development programs involve partnering with external stakeholders to jointly develop new technologies, products, or services.\n\nThere are also various websites and platforms that can facilitate open innovation, such as InnoCentive, which provides a platform for running innovation contests, and Innocentive@Work, which allows companies to set up their own innovation challenges for employees. Another popular platform is NineSigma, which connects companies with external experts and research institutions for collaborative R&D projects.\n\nOverall, open innovation can provide organizations with access to a broader range of resources and expertise, which can lead to more innovative and successful products and services.",
