ERP is, in a nutshell, the means of integrating individuals, processes, and technologies throughout a modern business. Obtaining appropriate, trustworthy, and maintainable ERP systems that can be used in businesses while also meeting the functional requirements of the organization, with a level of quality that is acceptable to the organization, is a significant challenge faced by majority of businesses in the country. Since maintainability is a crucial quality characteristic of software applications, ERP systems have occasionally been limited by maintainability issues. The process for predicting the maintainability of ERP software is explicitly described in this research and is based on design metrics and a statistical approach. The study explores if a set of metrics for class diagram structural attributes (size, complexity, coupling, and cohesion) could be useful indicators of class diagram maintainability based on the sub-characteristics of understandability, analyzability, and modifiability. Results show that the measures and recommended metrics can be used to identify the most powerful predictors and build useful prediction models for ERP applications. The statistical data study shows that while database and source code changes have a considerable impact on ERP maintainability quality, module customization has no effect on ERP quality. Our findings have repercussions for how firms implement customized ERP.",

In order to demonstrate the importance and necessity of software maintainability during the design phase, this paper expands the (MEMOOD) metrics model, which estimates the maintainability of class diagrams in terms of their understandability and modifiability, to create a multivariate linear model called \"Maintainability Estimation Framework and Metrics for Object Oriented Software (MEFOOS)\" during the design phase. Thus, class diagrams' maintainability is estimated in terms of their understandability, modifiability, and analyzability in the developed model. This study attempts, as a first effort, to create a relationship between object-oriented design features and maintainability elements analyzability, understandability, and modifiability. In spite of this, the study also created three further multivariate models to measure the class diagram's analyzability, understandability, and modifiability. Finally, the presented models have been empirically validated through the use of relevant statistical tests and reasoning from the context",
