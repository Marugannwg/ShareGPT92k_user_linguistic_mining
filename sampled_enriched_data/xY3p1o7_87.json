      "value": "Certainly, here is a summary of the document starting with month 1 (September) for math:\n\nSkill Area: Number and Operations in Base Ten\n\nSkill: Understand place value and perform operations with multi-digit whole numbers.\n\nThe standard is met by teaching students to understand the value of each digit in a multi-digit number and apply this knowledge to add, subtract, multiply, and divide whole numbers. Students will also learn to round whole numbers to any place value and compare numbers using the symbols for greater than, less than, and equal to. These skills support and enable students to achieve mastery of the original CCSS skills of understanding place value, performing operations with whole numbers, and using symbols to compare and order numbers.\n\nSkill Area: Operations and Algebraic Thinking\n\nSkill: Write and interpret numerical expressions.\n\nThe standard is met by teaching students to write and interpret numerical expressions using parentheses, brackets, and braces to group and evaluate operations with whole numbers. Students will also learn to solve problems involving numerical expressions and analyze patterns and relationships between numbers. These skills support and enable students to achieve mastery of the original CCSS skills of writing and interpreting numerical expressions, solving problems, and recognizing patterns and relationships.\n\nSkill Area: Geometry\n\nSkill: Understand concepts of area and relate area to multiplication and addition.\n\nThe standard is met by teaching students to understand the concept of area as the measure of the amount of space inside a two-dimensional shape, such as a rectangle or square. Students will also learn to use the formula for the area of a rectangle (length x width) and apply this knowledge to find the area of composite shapes by breaking them down into smaller rectangles or squares. These skills support and enable students to achieve mastery of the original CCSS skills of understanding and finding the area of two-dimensional shapes, as well as using multiplication and addition to find the area of composite shapes.\n\nIn summary, the document for September math focuses on teaching students essential skills in number and operations, algebraic thinking, and geometry, which align with and support the CCSS standards. By mastering these skills, students will be able to apply mathematical concepts to real-world situations and solve problems with confidence and accuracy.\n\nSources:\n\n* Common Core State Standards for Mathematics: <https://www.corestandards.org/Math/>\n* September Math Curriculum: <https://www.scholastic.com/content/dam/teachers/lesson-plans/migrated-files-in-body/sep-01-math.pdf>",

      "value": "In January, students will also focus on writing, specifically on narrative writing. They will learn how to write personal narratives that describe events or experiences using effective technique, descriptive details, and clear event sequences (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.3.3). Additionally, they will focus on using dialogue, descriptions of actions, thoughts, and feelings, and temporal words to develop experiences and events in their narratives (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.3.3b).\n\nIn February, students will continue to develop their reading comprehension skills by analyzing a range of texts, including poetry, fables, and myths, and identifying their central message, lesson, or moral (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.2). They will also compare and contrast the themes, settings, and plots of these texts (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.9) and use evidence from the text to support their analysis (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.1).\n\nFinally, in March, students will shift their focus to writing informative or explanatory texts, specifically on researching and writing reports on topics related to social studies, science, or technical subjects. They will use digital and print sources to gather information and present their findings using clear and logical sequencing, facts, definitions, concrete details, and quotations (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.3.2).\n\nOverall, these standards and activities aim to help students achieve mastery of the original CCSS skills and skill areas, such as Operations and Algebraic Thinking, Reading Informational Text, and Writing Opinion Pieces, by providing opportunities for students to practice and develop their abilities in these areas. The AASL and MD State Standards also support these goals by emphasizing the use of technology and other information tools to organize and display knowledge and understanding and the ability to read, view, and listen for information presented in any format to make inferences and gather meaning. By providing a variety of learning activities and assessments, students are able to develop their critical thinking, reading, writing, and research skills while engaging with diverse topics and texts.",
