It then describes the components of the system, which include a clinical chemistry analyzer, display monitor, controls, reagents, and disposable instrumentation. The profile also highlights the features of the VITROS MicroSlide technology, which is designed to minimize operator interventions and increase ease of use. Another feature of the analyzer is the VITROS Intellicheck technology, which is intended to provide real-time process monitoring and reduce the risk of incorrect result reporting.

Remember the structure, style and content in context to the product description manual:\n\nThe Sofia Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer is a bench top analyzer used for fluorescent detection of various pathogens. The system uses an ultraviolet LED source and a sensor to collect data from each test cassette. Available tests which are purchased separately include hCG, Influenza A and B, RSV, and Strep A. The analyzer may be used in two different workflow modes. The walk away mode is designed for use with a single patient sample that is placed in the Sofia and the cassette is developed and scanned before displaying the results. The read now mode is designed for use with several patient samples and the user manually develops the sample outside the analyzer. Once development is complete, the sample is placed in the Sofia and immediately scanned. Results are displayed within one minute. \n\nThe Sofia Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer has an integrated printer and results may be printed, stored on the provided SD card, or sent to a laboratory information system (LIS).\n\nAbove Here is an example of an immunoassay system product profile.
