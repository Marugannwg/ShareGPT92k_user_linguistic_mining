      "value": "Native American populations were decimated by exposure to European diseases because they had not previously been exposed to many of the diseases that were common in Europe, such as smallpox, measles, and influenza. As a result, they had no immunity to these diseases, and they spread quickly and were highly lethal among Native American populations. In contrast, European explorers had been exposed to many of the diseases present in the Americas and had developed some immunity to them. This is why they were less affected by diseases they encountered in the New World.\n\nIt's worth noting that while European explorers may have been less affected by diseases they encountered in the New World, they still suffered from outbreaks of illness and disease, and many died as a result of their exposure to new diseases. Additionally, the arrival of Europeans in the Americas also had a major impact on Native American populations through violence, displacement, and other forms of colonization and exploitation, which further contributed to the decline of Native American populations.",
