      "value": "Sure, here are some additional works that have been done in relation to the implementation of sustainable development goals in urban planning practices:\n\n1. Urban Sustainable Development Goal Index: The Urban SDG Index is a tool developed by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network to assess the performance of cities in achieving the SDGs. The index provides a comprehensive assessment of a city's progress towards achieving the SDGs, including SDG 11, which focuses on sustainable cities and communities.\n2. Compact of Mayors: The Compact of Mayors is a global coalition of mayors committed to taking action on climate change. The initiative provides guidance and support for cities to set targets and measure their progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable urban development.\n3. The Future of Cities: The Future of Cities is a joint initiative by the World Economic Forum and the McKinsey Global Institute. The initiative provides insights and recommendations for policymakers and urban planners on how to promote sustainable urban development and address the challenges facing cities, such as rapid urbanization and climate change.\n4. The Urban Institute: The Urban Institute is a nonprofit research organization focused on social and economic policy issues. The organization conducts research on a wide range of urban issues, including affordable housing, transportation, and sustainable urban development.\n5. Green Infrastructure: Green infrastructure refers to the network of natural and semi-natural features, such as parks, green roofs, and wetlands, that provide a range of environmental, social, and economic benefits in urban areas. There is growing interest in incorporating green infrastructure into urban planning practices as a way to promote sustainable development.\n6. Smart Cities: Smart Cities are urban areas that leverage technology and data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of urban services and infrastructure. Smart Cities have the potential to promote sustainable development by optimizing resource use, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing quality of life for urban residents.\n\nThese works demonstrate the broad range of initiatives, tools, and frameworks available to support sustainable development in urban planning practices. However, the challenge remains to effectively implement these approaches and overcome the barriers to sustainable urban development.",
