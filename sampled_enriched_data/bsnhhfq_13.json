      "value": "After creating the homepage, the next step would be to create the \"Getting Started\" section. This section should cover:\n\n* How to install EZSGAME and its dependencies.\n* How to set up a new project and create a basic EZSGAME project.\n* A brief explanation of how to run the project.\n* Any other information that would be helpful for users to know when getting started with EZSGAME.\n\nThe \"Core Concepts\" section would come next, this section should provide an overview of the core concepts and classes in EZSGAME, such as `Window`, `Vector2`, and `Text`. It should also explain how these classes are used together to create a basic EZSGAME project.\n\nThen, the \"Reference\" section should provide detailed documentation for each class and function in EZSGAME. It should be divided into sub-sections for each file in the library, such as `__init__.py`, `window.py`, and so on. Each page should include a description of the class or function, its methods and attributes, and example usage.\n\nAfter that you can add the \"Examples\" section, which will provide examples of how to use EZSGAME to create different types of projects, such as games, animations, and interactive visualizations. Each example should include the code, screenshots, and a brief explanation of how it works.\n\nFinally, you can add the \"Advanced Topics\" section and the \"Troubleshooting\" section. The former will cover more advanced features of EZSGAME, such as customizing the renderer, creating custom shapes, and working with audio. The latter will provide solutions to common problems that users may encounter when using EZSGAME.\n\nAnd the last one is the \"Changelog\" section which will show the updates and fixes on each version of the library.\n\nPlease let me know if you need help with creating any of these sections.",
