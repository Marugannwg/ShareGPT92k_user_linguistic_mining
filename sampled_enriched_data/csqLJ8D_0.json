      "value": "There are many researchers and institutions that study glioma evolution, so it is difficult to identify a single world authority in this area. However, I can suggest some prominent researchers and institutions that have made significant contributions to the field of glioma evolution.\n\nOne researcher who has made significant contributions to the study of glioma evolution is Dr. Roel Verhaak, who is currently the Chief Informatics Officer at the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine. Dr. Verhaak has published numerous papers on the genomics of glioma, including a 2015 paper in the journal Cell titled \"Integrated Genomic Analysis Identifies Clinically Relevant Subtypes of Glioblastoma Characterized by Abnormalities in PDGFRA, IDH1, EGFR, and NF1\". This paper has been cited over 2,600 times, according to Google Scholar.\n\nAnother researcher who has made significant contributions to the field of glioma evolution is Dr. Mark Gilbert, who is the Chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Gilbert has conducted extensive research on the genetics and genomics of gliomas, and has published numerous papers on the subject. One of his most cited papers is a 2014 paper in the journal Neuro-Oncology titled \"Comprehensive genomic characterization of tumors: implications for targeted and individualized therapeutics\", which has been cited over 800 times, according to Google Scholar.\n\nInstitutions that are at the forefront of studying glioma evolution include the National Cancer Institute, the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, and the University of California, San Francisco's Brain Tumor Center. These institutions have dedicated research programs and teams focused on understanding the genetic and genomic changes that occur in gliomas, as well as developing new treatments and therapies for these deadly brain tumors.\n\nOverall, while it is difficult to identify a single world authority on studying glioma evolution, there are many researchers and institutions that are making significant contributions to the field.",
