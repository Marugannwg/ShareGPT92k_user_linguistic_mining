      "value": "No problem, Petar B. I'll continue answering the questions from where we left off.\n\n1. Education inside the Tiamat zone is primarily focused on survival skills and practical knowledge. There might be a few individuals who have retained pre-apocalyptic knowledge and try to teach others, but the overall state of education is quite rudimentary. Outside the Tiamat zone, in the Hybrid-controlled territories, education is more advanced but highly controlled, focusing on indoctrination and ensuring compliance with the ruling class. In the lawless regions, education varies greatly depending on the local community.\n2. Art and culture have evolved differently inside and outside the Tiamat zone. Inside the zone, art has taken on a more primal, folkloric form, reflecting the harsh realities of life and the mysteries surrounding Tiamat. Outside the zone, art might be more heavily influenced by Hybrid aesthetics or used as a form of resistance against the oppressive regime.\n3. Technology plays a minimal role in the daily lives of people inside the Tiamat zone due to the field's effects. People rely on basic tools and pre-electricity technology for their survival. Outside the zone, technology is more advanced but less reliable due to Tiamat radiation. The reliance on technology has decreased in some areas, while others have adapted to the new challenges by developing more robust, radiation-resistant technologies.\n4. People inside the Tiamat zone tend to view the outside world with a mix of fear and curiosity. They are aware of the Hybrid-controlled societies and the chaos that reigns in the lawless regions but have limited knowledge of the specifics. Conversely, people outside the zone often view the inhabitants of the Tiamat zone as primitive and superstitious, with little understanding of their unique challenges and way of life.\n5. There are organized resistance movements against the Hybrid governments, both inside and outside the Tiamat zone. These groups operate in secret, using guerrilla tactics and covert communication methods. Their goals may vary, ranging from the liberation of oppressed human populations to the destruction of the Hybrids themselves.\n6. Hybrids maintain control over their territories through a combination of advanced technology, brutal force, and psychological manipulation. They use surveillance systems, military power, and propaganda to ensure compliance and loyalty from the human population.\n7. People inside the Tiamat zone obtain necessary resources through farming, hunting, and gathering. They also trade with neighboring settlements and may have developed unique methods of resource management and distribution to cope with the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world, such as communal sharing or bartering systems.\n8. New religions and spiritual practices have emerged inside the Tiamat zone in response to the mysterious phenomena and the presence of Tiamat. These belief systems often focus on the \"wounded god\" and incorporate elements of hope, resilience, and reverence for the forces of nature.\n9. The role of family and community is crucial in both the Tiamat zone and the outside world. In the face of the apocalypse and the new world order, the bonds between people have generally grown stronger, with communities relying on one another for support and survival.\n10. People inside the Tiamat zone and the outside world cope with the psychological and emotional challenges of living in a post-apocalyptic world through various means, such as forming support networks, engaging in spiritual practices, or seeking solace in art and storytelling. Unique coping mechanisms and support systems have developed in response to these challenges, helping individuals and communities to navigate the hardships and uncertainties of their new reality.",
