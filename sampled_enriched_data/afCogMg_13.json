Eligibility for the program is determined by the individual's country of birth, and there are limitations on the number of visas that can be issued to individuals from each country or region. To apply for the DV-2024 program, individuals must submit their electronic entry during the designated registration period, which runs from 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Daylight Time on Wednesday, October 5, 2022, to 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, November 8, 2022. Entrants must only submit one entry during the registration period and must include all eligible family members on their entry form. Selected individuals will be notified through the Entrant Status Check available on the E-DV website at dvprogram.state.gov from May 6, 2023, through September 30, 2024. The Department of State will not notify individuals directly if their entry is not selected and will not send notifications via email or postal mail.",

Each of these forms received by USCIS on or after April 1 must have its own fee payment instrument or we will reject the entire package. \n\nUSCIS is transitioning to electronic processing of immigration benefit requests. As we complete this transition, USCIS will be using multiple systems to receipt and process various types of immigration benefit requests. Because H-1B and H-1B1 petitions and related applications are not all processed in the same system, USCIS requires a separate payment instrument for each of these forms. USCIS acknowledges that using multiple checks or payments for H-1B and H-1B1 petitions and related applications is more burdensome than using one payment. USCIS is always analyzing its forms, practices, and policies to streamline filing and reduce, minimize and control burdens to submit requests. However, USCIS believes that the advantages of electronic processing to both the agency and to the public outweigh the minor impacts of submitting individual fee payments.",
