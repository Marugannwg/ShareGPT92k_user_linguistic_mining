If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\n(2) The right conferred by sub-section (1) exists only for so long as the respondent fails to comply with the requirements referred to in s 15(1), 16(1) or 25(1), as the case may be.”\n214 Of “the requirements referred to in s 15(1), 16(1) or 25(1)”, those in s 15(1)(b) are presently relevant. Those requirements comprise the obligation of a “respondent” to “pay the whole or any part of the claimed amount on or before the due date for the progress payment to which the payment claim relates”.\n215 The payment made by the Council to Beckhaus on 18 November 2002 was subject to the condition that it be secured by a bank guarantee provided at the instance of Beckhaus. Mr Christie accepted that, without the bank guarantee, the Council would not have paid the amount of progress claim No 7.\n216 By reason of the requirement to provide a bank guarantee, Beckhaus did not have access to the funds represented by the payment for use in its day to day operations.\n217 Master Macready held that a payment that was conditional on the provision of a bank guarantee did not remove the suspension under s 27 of the Act. In coming to this conclusion he relied on “the imperative of giving effect to the purpose of the statutory right of suspension”. He said:\n\n“[T]he remedy provided by s 27 of the Act is capable of achieving its full intended function only if the payment which terminates the claimant’s right of suspension can be applied to defray expenses and liabilities incurred in carrying out the work to which the progress payment relates.”\n218 I agree with the view so expressed. In Brodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport (2004) 61 NSWLR 421 Hodgson JA (with whom Mason P and Giles JA agreed) said:\n\n“The Act discloses a legislative intention to give an entitlement to progress payments, and to provide a mechanism to ensure that disputes concerning the amount of such payments are resolved with the minimum of delay. The payments themselves are only payments on account of a liability that will be finally determined otherwise: ss 3(4), 32. The procedure contemplates a minimum of opportunity for court involvement: ss 3(3), 25(4).”\n219 The purpose of the Act was to ensure that contractors and sub-contractors, in the circumstances stipulated, could obtain a prompt interim progress payment on account, pending final determination of all disputes (Brodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport [2003] NSWSC 1019 per Einstein J; see also Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd v Luikens [2003] NSWSC 1140 at [96] per Palmer J). If the requirements of the Act concerning such interim progress payments could be satisfied by payments made conditionally against the provision of bank guarantees, the purpose of the Act would be defeated. In the circumstances, I agree that the payment of 18 November 2002 did not cause the suspension to cease; the suspension continued until the Contract was terminated.",

      "value": "This is my last message that form part of the case, Brewarrina Shire Council v Beckhaus Civil Pty Ltd & 1 Or [2005] NSWCA 248. This is the 24th message of the messages that comprises the case. Together these messages comprises the complete judgement for the case of Brewarrina Shire Council v Beckhaus Civil Pty Ltd & 1 Or [2005] NSWCA 248. If you understand then please reply by saying \"acknowledged\". If you understand, only reply\"acknowledged\".\n\n220 In the circumstances, the claim for liquidated damages is capable of running from, the latest, March 2002 (the date for practical completion accepted by the Council – but not by Beckhaus) to 27 May 2002 when Beckhaus suspended work. This is a relatively short period.\n221 In refusing leave to the Council to amend so as to claim liquidated damages, the Master, amongst other things, balanced the cost and inconvenience of the further hearing that would be required to establish the date for practical completion against the relatively small amount to which the Council might be entitled in respect of liquidated damages (having regard to his findings relating to the suspension of work under the Act).\n222 In the light of the orders that I propose, Macready AsJ might be disposed to allow further evidence on one or more of the several issues remitted to him. I make no comment on the prospects of this occurring, this being (as I have said) a matter entirely within his discretion. The prospect, however, of further evidence being led on the other issues does, however, constitute a change of circumstances relative to the Master’s decision not to allow the claim for liquidated damages.\n223 In my opinion, fairness requires the Master’s decision to refuse to allow the claim for liquidated damages to be set aside so as to allow the Council, if it wishes, to renew the application before his Honour when the matter is remitted. If Macready AsJ determines the other issues remitted to him without allowing any further evidence, I would have thought it unlikely that he would allow the claim for liquidated damages to proceed (as his reasoning, as previously expressed, would remain the same). On the other hand, were evidence to be allowed, Macready AsJ might consider that it would be fair to allow evidence to be led in support of the dates necessary to establish a right on the part of the Council to liquidated damages. For this reason I propose that orders be made setting aside the Master’s decision to refuse leave to amend so as to claim liquidated damages and remitting the issue to him for decision when determining all the issues that I propose be returned to Macready AsJ for decision afresh.\nThe costs relating to Mr Beckhaus\n224 Before the Master counsel submitted that there should be no costs orders in favour of Beckhaus and Mr Beckhaus because of the finding that they had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act.\n225 The Master rejected the submission that the misleading conduct was the “prime reason” for starting the litigation. He said:\n\n“The litigation was started because of concerns the Council felt about the work that had been performed by [Beckhaus] under the contract.”\n\nHe refused to deprive Beckhaus and Mr Beckhaus of their costs against the Council.\n226 It has not been shown that the Master was wrong and I would not uphold this argument.\n227 By reason, however, of the orders that I propose (remitting a number of the issues to Macready AsJ), I would set aside the costs orders he made, generally, on the basis that those orders should be reconsidered by him in the light of the findings he makes upon remission of all the issues in question. The purpose in setting aside those orders is to allow Macready AsJ full discretion to make whatever costs orders he thinks appropriate in the light of his overall decision in the case as remitted.\nConclusion\n228 On the conclusions to which I have come, the Council has been more successful than Beckhaus. For the purposes of considering the appropriate order to be made in respect of the costs of the appeal, however, I would note that Beckhaus has been successful on some issues that took some time to argue and were not insignificant. Moreover, much time was spent on canvassing questions that became irrelevant once the Council accepted that the Contract had been terminated by mutual agreement. On balance, I think it would be fair if Beckhaus be ordered to pay 70% of the Council’s costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.\n229 I propose the following orders:\n(1) The appeal be allowed.\n\n(2) The orders made by Master Macready following his judgments of 16 September 2004 and 7 December 2004 be set aside.\n\n(3) Beckhaus pay 70% of the Council’s costs of the appeal and cross-appeal, and to have a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act , if otherwise eligible.\n\n(4) The following issues be remitted to Macready AsJ to determine in the light of these reasons:\n(i) The costs of rectifying the work at the culverts.\n(ii) The extent to which the levees constructed by Beckhaus did not comply with the requirement of 12% maximum linear shrinkage, and the costs of rectifying the work that was defective in this respect.\n(iii) The amount the Council would have paid to Beckhaus (including amounts due for variations affecting the cost of the work) if all the work had been duly completed by it in accordance with the Contract.\n(iv) The amount, if any, owing to Beckhaus by the Council for work that advanced the completion of the Contract (as assessed in accordance with these reasons).\n(v) The amount, if any, owing to Beckhaus by the Council in respect of the amount claimed under Variation 21.\n(vi) The amount, if any, owing to the Council by Beckhaus in respect of its cross-claims (as assessed in accordance with these reasons).\n(vii) Whether the Council should be given leave to amend its claim so as to be able to claim liquidated damages, and the resolution of such a claim (if it be allowed).\n\n(viii) Interest, if any.\n\n(ix) The costs of the trial and the remitted hearing.\n230 McCOLL JA: I agree with Ipp JA.",
