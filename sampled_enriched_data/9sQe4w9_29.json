(I'm sorry, I don't think I'm the best wingman for you)\n\nMan: (surprised) Really? You're always by my side, I thought you would want to come with me.\n\nDog: Woof woof woof! (I love spending time with you, but I don't think I'll be much help at a party)\n\nMan: (disappointed) Oh, I see. I really need someone to help me talk to people and I was hoping you could assist me.\n\nDog: Woof woof! (I'm sorry, I can't help you with that)\n\nMan: (sighs) Oh well, I'll have to figure something else out.\n\nDog: Woof woof woof! (I'll be here for you if you need any other kind of assistance)\n\nIn this version, the man ask the dog to be his wingman at a party, but the dog is not able to assist him with it. This dialogue highlights the man's need for assistance in socializing and the dog's inability to help him with it.",
