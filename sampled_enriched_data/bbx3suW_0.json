Recruit a group of test participants who are representative of the target users, such as security screeners or baggage X-RAY operators.\n2. Provide a brief training on how to use the suitcase building tool and its features.\n3. Ask the participants to complete a series of tasks, such as creating a suitcase with simulated threat objects, adjusting the size and shape of the suitcase, and saving and loading the suitcase designs.\n4. Observe the participants as they complete the tasks and take note of any issues they encounter, such as difficulty navigating the interface or understanding how to use certain features.\n5. After the participants have completed the tasks, ask them to provide feedback on the tool, including any suggestions for improvements.\n6. Analyze the results of the usability test, including any issues encountered by the participants and their feedback, to identify areas for improvement in the tool.\n7. Use the results of the usability test to make changes and improvements to the tool before its release.\n\nNote: Usability testing is an ongoing process and should be repeated regularly to ensure that the tool continues to meet the needs of its users and remains user-friendly over time.\n\nList of tasks for the Participants in the Usability Test for Suitcase Building Tool:\n\n1. Create a suitcase with simulated threat objects, such as weapons or explosives, and place them in specific locations within the suitcase.\n2. Adjust the size and shape of the suitcase to simulate different types of luggage.\n3. Save and load the suitcase designs for later use.\n4. Use different materials for the suitcase.\n5. Test the suitcase in the X-Ray machine.\n6. Provide feedback on the tool and suggest improvements.\n\nNote: The tasks should be designed to simulate real-world scenarios and should challenge the participants to use the tool in a variety of ways, so that the usability of the tool can be thoroughly evaluated.",
