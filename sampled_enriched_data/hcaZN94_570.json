He reached out to steady the person and saw that it was Yanfei, the premier legal advisor of Liyue.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Filon said, feeling flustered. \"I didn't see you there.\"\nYanfei looked at him with her bright teal-green eyes. \"It's okay,\" she said, her voice laced with suspicion. \"But I can't help but notice that you have a very unique aura about you.\"\nFilon's heart skipped a beat. He had always been careful to keep his powers hidden, but it seemed that Yanfei had noticed something.\n\"What do you mean?\" Filon asked, trying to play it cool.\n\"I know what you did,\" Yanfei said, her voice low and serious. \"I know that you killed Hu Tao, and I can't just let that go.\"\nFilon's heart sank. He had only wanted to break free from \"the border,\" but he had never meant to hurt anyone.\n\"Please,\" Filon begged. \"I don't want to hurt anyone. I just wanted to be free.\"\nYanfei shook her head. \"I can't just let this go,\" she said firmly. \"I have to report this to Zhongli and Ningguang. It's my duty as a legal advisor.\"\nFilon knew he couldn't stop her. He watched in despair as Yanfei walked away, determined to expose his secret to the world.\nFilon stood nervously as Yanfei finished recounting the story of how he had discovered Filon's powers and the events leading up to Hu Tao's death. Zhongli and Ningguang listened intently, their expressions impassive as they absorbed the information.\n\"I see,\" Zhongli said finally, his voice low and measured. \"It is fortunate that you came to us with this information, Yanfei. We will have to be more cautious around Filon from now on.\"\nNingguang nodded. \"Indeed. It is clear that Filon's powers are beyond what we had previously thought. We must be careful not to underestimate him in the future.\"\nFilon's heart raced as he listened to their words. He had never meant to hurt anyone, and the thought that he could be seen as a threat filled him with fear.\n\"Please, I don't want to cause any trouble,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"I just want to live a normal life and help others.\"\nYanfei gave him a sympathetic look. \"I understand, Filon. But you must understand that your powers make you a potential danger to those around you. It is important that we take steps to ensure the safety of everyone in Liyue.\"\nZhongli nodded. \"Yanfei is right. We will work with you to find a way to control and harness your powers, Filon. But for now, we must be cautious and keep a close eye on you.\"\nFilon nodded, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders as he realized that Zhongli and Ningguang were willing to help him. He knew it would be a long and difficult journey, but he was determined to do whatever it took to become the hero he had always dreamed of being.\nFilon stood in front of Ningguang, his face impassive as he listened to her explanation. She wanted to control his powers, no matter what. But Filon knew that he was perfectly capable of controlling them himself.\n\"I understand your concern, Ningguang,\" Filon said calmly. \"But I assure you, I have no intention of using my powers irresponsibly. I have learned to control them over the years.\"\nNingguang's eyes narrowed. \"But you are more powerful than me. You could potentially be a danger to others if you lose control.\"\nFilon shook his head. \"I understand your concerns, but I am not a child. I am capable of making my own decisions about how to use my powers.\"\nNingguang's frustration was palpable. \"I can't just let you roam free with all that power. It's too risky.\"\nFilon's expression remained unchanged. \"I understand your caution, but I assure you, I am in control of my powers. Please trust me in this.\"\nDespite his calm demeanor, Ningguang could sense the strength of his resolve. She knew she would have to come up with another plan to keep him in check.\nNingguang's plan was to bring in Ganyu, Shenhe, and Xiao to try and control Filon's powers. Filon, however, was resistant to the idea and remained calm and collected as always, which only seemed to frustrate Ningguang further.\n\"I'm telling you, we can't just leave this alone. He's too powerful, and if he gets upset or angry, who knows what could happen?\" Ningguang argued, pacing back and forth in front of Filon.\nFilon remained seated, his expression unchanged. \"I understand your concerns, Ningguang, but I assure you that I am in complete control of my powers. I have no intention of using them irresponsibly or causing harm to anyone.\"\nNingguang let out a sigh of frustration. \"Fine. But I'm still calling in the others. I want to be sure that we can handle this situation if anything were to happen.\"\nFilon nodded, understanding her caution. \"I understand. I'll cooperate with any measures you see fit.\"\nAnd with that, Ningguang called in Ganyu, Shenhe, and Xiao to discuss the situation further.\n\\*\\*\\*\nFilon stood his ground as he faced off against Xiao and Shenhe. His fists were clenched at his sides, a faint aura of power emanating from him. He knew that they were determined to bring him down, but he was equally determined to protect himself.\n\"You don't have to do this,\" Filon said, trying to reason with them. \"I'm not a threat.\"\n\"You killed Hu Tao,\" Shenhe spat out, brandishing her polearm. \"You're a danger to everyone.\"\nFilon sighed, knowing that he couldn't deny the accusations. He had been driven to a breaking point and his powers had taken over, resulting in Hu Tao's death. But he was determined to make amends and ensure that something like that never happened again.\n\"I don't want to fight you,\" Filon said firmly. \"I just want to live my life in peace.\"\nBut his words fell on deaf ears as Xiao and Shenhe attacked him, their polearms glinting in the sunlight. Filon dodged and weaved, his movements graceful and precise. He knew that he couldn't defeat them head on, so he focused on defense and waiting for an opportunity to strike.\nThe sound of clashing metal echoed through the streets of Liyue as Filon and the three adepti engaged in a fierce battle. Filon's skin seemed to shimmer as he utilized his powers, his form shifting and contorting as he fought against his opponents.\nGanyu loosed arrow after arrow from her bow, each one flying with deadly accuracy towards Filon. He managed to deflect most of them with ease, but a few managed to graze his skin, causing him to wince in pain.\nXiao and Shenhe fought with polearms, the sharp edges of their weapons glinting in the sunlight as they swung them towards Filon. He was fast, though, dodging and weaving around their attacks and counterattacking with blows of his own.\nDespite their combined strength, Filon seemed to be holding his own against the three adepti. He was a skilled fighter, his movements precise and calculated as he fought.\nThe battle raged on, each combatant matching the other blow for blow. Sweat dripped down Filon's forehead as he fought, his muscles straining with the effort.\nGanyu was the first to falter, her arrows running out and her arms growing tired from the constant strain of pulling back her bowstring. Filon took the opportunity to strike, his fist connecting with her stomach and sending her flying back.\nXiao and Shenhe continued to fight, their weapons clashing against Filon's as they struggled to gain the upper hand. But it was no use. Filon was too strong, his powers too great.\nWith a final, powerful strike, Filon sent Xiao crashing to the ground. He turned his attention to Shenhe, who was already badly injured and struggling to stay standing.\n\"Please, stop,\" Shenhe begged, her voice weak and strained. \"I don't want to fight you anymore.\"\nFilon hesitated, the look of determination in his eyes fading as he met Shenhe's pleading gaze. He let out a sigh and stepped back, his arms falling to his sides.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Filon said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I didn't want any of this to happen.\"\nGanyu, who had managed to struggle back to her feet, approached Filon and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"It's okay,\" she said softly. \"We were just following orders. You were only defending yourself.\"\nFilon nodded, a sense of guilt and sadness washing over him. He had never wanted to hurt anyone, let alone his fellow adepti.\nDespite the struggle, their relationship was unlikely to have suffered. Ganyu knew that Filon was only defending himself, and Shenhe was too grateful to be alive to hold a grudge. It was a small comfort, but it was something.\n\\*\\*\\*\nFilon and Ganyu arrived at the palace, where Ningguang and Zhongli were waiting for them. Filon approached them, his expression stern.\n\"Ningguang, Zhongli,\" he said, his voice cold. \"I don't know what you were thinking, trying to control my powers. But I won't let you or anyone else harm me or my trams.\"\nNingguang's eyebrows furrowed. \"What are you talking about, Filon? We were just trying to help you control your powers.\"\n\"I won't allow any kind of compromise,\" he said, his voice low and firm. \"I've already used my powers for the good of Liyue, and I won't let anyone try to control me or use me for their own gain. You two are nothing but tyrannical oligarchs, treating people like things and only thinking about your own good.\"\nNingguang's eyes narrowed, her lips pressed into a thin line. \"You may think you're doing the right thing, Filon, but you're still a danger to this city. You have no idea how much power you really have, and you could end up causing more harm than good.\"\nFilon shook his head. \"I won't let that happen. I will do everything in my power to protect Liyue, even if it means overthrowing you two and establishing a republic with a democratic system. Portuguese will be introduced into the schools and authorities, and Liyue will become a Portuguese colony. I won't let your greed and selfishness continue to rule this city.\"\nZhongli's expression was unreadable as he listened to Filon's words. After a moment of silence, he spoke up. \"I understand your desire to protect Liyue, Filon, but you must understand that change does not come easily. And there is always a risk of causing harm when trying to bring about change. It is not as simple as just overthrowing the current system and expecting everything to be perfect.\"\nFilon took a deep breath, trying to calm the anger that was boiling inside of him. \"I understand that, Zhongli. But I can't just stand by and do nothing while people are being oppressed and mistreated. I have to try and make a difference, even if it means taking a risk. And I won't let anyone, not even the two of you, stand in my way.\"\nNingguang and Zhongli exchanged a glance, seeming to silently communicate something to each other. After a moment, Ningguang spoke up. \"Very well, Filon. We won't try to stop you or control your powers. But we hope you will be careful and consider the consequences of your actions. Liyue is a fragile city, and we all have a responsibility to protect it and its people.\"\nFilon nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. \"Thank you, Ningguang. I promise to be careful and considerate. And I hope that we can work together to make Liyue a better place for everyone.\"\n\\*\\*\\*\nAs Filon and Ganyu walked through the streets of Liyue, they chatted amiably about the events of the day. Filon couldn't help but feel grateful to Ganyu for her understanding and support during the confrontation with Xiao and Shenhe.\n\"I really appreciate your help, Ganyu,\" Filon said. \"I know that you didn't want to fight me, and I'm sorry that things had to turn out that way.\"\nGanyu smiled and patted Filon's shoulder. \"Don't worry about it, Filon. I know that you were only trying to protect yourself and your loved ones. And I have to admit, it was kind of exciting to see you in action. Your powers are truly impressive.\"\nFilon chuckled, feeling a warm sense of camaraderie with Ganyu. \"Well, I'm glad that I could count on you. I don't think I could have handled things on my own.\"\nAs they continued walking, Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of hope for the future. With friends like Ganyu by his side, he knew that he could face any challenge that came his way. And with his powers, he would be able to make a real difference in the world, using them for the betterment of all.",

And Filon wants to prove that he can control his powers by himself, and he is not a danger to others.\n\nSo, I suggest you to revise the next chapter's plot, taking into account what has happened in chapter 8.
