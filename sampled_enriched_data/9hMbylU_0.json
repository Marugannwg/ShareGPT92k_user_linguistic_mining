      "value": "\"Save the Cat\" is a book by screenwriter Blake Snyder that outlines a method for writing screenplays. The method is based on the idea that a story should be structured around 15 \"beats,\" or key events that drive the plot forward and help to build tension and conflict. The beats are:\n\n1. The Opening Image: This is the first image that appears on screen and sets the tone for the rest of the film.\n2. Theme Stated: The theme of the film is introduced early on, usually through dialogue or narration.\n3. Set-Up: The set-up establishes the main character and their world.\n4. Catalyst: The catalyst is an event that sets the story in motion and causes the main character to take action.\n5. Debate: The main character debates whether or not to take action in response to the catalyst.\n6. Break into Two: The main character makes a decision and takes action, setting the story on its main course.\n7. B Story: The B story is a secondary plotline that runs parallel to the main story and helps to deepen the themes and characters.\n8. Fun and Games: The fun and games is the main part of the film where the main character pursues their goal and faces obstacles.\n9. Midpoint: The midpoint is a turning point in the story where the main character's fortunes change, either for better or for worse.\n10. Bad Guys Close In: The main character's enemies or obstacles become more formidable and start to close in.\n11. All Is Lost: The main character experiences a major setback and feels like all is lost.\n12. Dark Night of the Soul: The main character hits rock bottom and must confront their inner demons.\n13. Break into Three: The main character finds a new resolve and takes action to turn their fortunes around.\n14. Finale: The main character faces their final challenge and achieves their goal.\n15. Final Image: The final image is the last thing the audience sees and should be a reflection of the theme of the film.",

Here is an example of how the \"Save the Cat\" beats could be adapted to fit the structure of the novel:\n\n1. The Opening Image: The first image of the book is a depiction of Sheila's chaotic, cluttered apartment, which reflects her disorganized and uncertain state of mind.\n2. Theme Stated: The theme of the book is introduced through Sheila's internal monologue as she grapples with the question of how a person should be.\n3. Set-Up: The set-up establishes Sheila's world, including her relationships with her friends, her career as an artist, and her struggles with anxiety and self-doubt.\n4. Catalyst: The catalyst is Sheila's decision to write a play about how a person should be, which sets the story in motion and prompts her to seek out mentors and advice.\n5. Debate: Sheila debates whether or not to pursue the project, worrying about her own lack of talent and confidence.\n6. Break into Two: Sheila decides to go forward with the project and begins to interview her friends and mentors for their insights on how a person should be.\n7. B Story: The B story is Sheila's relationship with her friend Margaux, which serves as a foil to Sheila's own struggles and provides a counterpoint to the main story.\n8. Fun and Games: The fun and games is the main part of the book where Sheila works on the play and grapples with the various conflicting pieces of advice she receives.\n9. Midpoint: The midpoint is a turning point in the story where Sheila's fortunes change, either for better or for worse. For example, she might have a breakthrough in her writing or a major setback.\n10. Bad Guys Close In: The main character's enemies or obstacles become more formidable and start to close in. For example, Sheila might face criticism or rejection of her work.\n11. All Is Lost: Sheila experiences a major setback and feels like all is lost. For example, she might have a major disagreement with a friend or a creative block.\n12. Dark Night of the Soul: Sheila hits rock bottom and must confront her inner demons. For example, she might have a crisis of identity or a moment of self-doubt.\n13. Break into Three: Sheila finds a new resolve and takes action to turn her fortunes around. For example, she might seek out a new source of inspiration or support.\n14. Finale: Sheila faces her final challenge and achieves her goal. For example, she might complete the play or find a sense of self-acceptance.\n15. Final Image: The final image is the last thing the reader sees and should be a reflection of the theme of the book.

I would like you to create Save The Cat beats based on the outline. \n\n“Sam Has Dead Eyes” is a semi-autobiographical novel that explores themes of identity, fatherhood, manhood, and art. The novel follows an unnamed narrator as he grapples with questions about how best to live a meaningful and authentic life, and more specifically, how to be both a dedicated father and committed artist. \n\nThe protagonist is a young artist living in Los Angeles who is trying to find his place in the world. While his wife is away on a business trip, he struggles to meet a screenplay deadline while taking care of his two young children who demand his attention. Feeling lost and unsure of himself, the narrator attempts, throughout the novel, to seek guidance from other fathers and artists around him, but struggles to find any noteworthy role models. \n\nMeanwhile, his best friend, Blake, a director of short films whose girlfriend recently fell pregnant, is trying to decide whether or not to become a father himself. And, midway through the novel, another friend comes to visit: Sam, a new father who comes to stay with the narrator after getting kicked out of his house. \n\nAs the narrator navigates his relationships and creative pursuits, he grapples with questions about meaning, love, sex, parenting, manhood, and art. Overall, “Sam Has Dead Eyes” is a thought-provoking and introspective novel that explores the complexities of identity, meaning, fatherhood, and art.",

      "value": "\"Sam Has Dead Eyes\" sounds like a thought-provoking and introspective novel that explores complex themes of identity, fatherhood, manhood, and art. Here is an example of how the \"Save the Cat\" beats could be adapted to fit the structure of the novel:\n\n1. The Opening Image: The first image of the book is a depiction of the narrator's chaotic home life, with his two young children demanding his attention and a deadline for his screenplay looming. This image sets the tone for the rest of the book and reflects the protagonist's sense of overwhelm and uncertainty.\n2. Theme Stated: The theme of the book is introduced through the narrator's internal monologue as he grapples with questions about how to live a meaningful and authentic life and how to balance his roles as a father and artist.\n3. Set-Up: The set-up establishes the protagonist's world, including his relationships with his wife, children, and friends, as well as his career as an artist.\n4. Catalyst: The catalyst is the protagonist's wife's business trip, which leaves him alone with the children and under pressure to meet his screenplay deadline. This event sets the story in motion and prompts the narrator to seek out guidance and support.\n5. Debate: The narrator debates whether or not to seek out guidance from other fathers and artists, worried about appearing vulnerable or seeking validation from others.\n6. Break into Two: The narrator decides to go forward with seeking out guidance and begins to interview and observe other fathers and artists in his life.\n7. B Story: The B story is Blake's struggle with deciding whether or not to become a father, which serves as a foil to the narrator's own struggles and provides a counterpoint to the main story.\n8. Fun and Games: The fun and games is the main part of the book where the narrator navigates his relationships and creative pursuits, seeking out guidance and facing challenges along the way.\n9. Midpoint: The midpoint is a turning point in the story where the narrator's fortunes change, either for better or for worse. For example, he might have a breakthrough in his writing or a major setback.\n10. Bad Guys Close In: The main character's enemies or obstacles become more formidable and start to close in. For example, the narrator might face criticism or rejection of his work.\n11. All Is Lost: The narrator experiences a major setback and feels like all is lost. For example, he might have a major disagreement with a friend or a creative block.\n12. Dark Night of the Soul: The narrator hits rock bottom and must confront his inner demons. For example, he might have a crisis of identity or a moment of self-doubt.\n13. Break into Three: The narrator finds a new resolve and takes action to turn his fortunes around. For example, he might seek out a new source of inspiration or support.\n14. Finale: The narrator faces his final challenge and achieves his goal. For example, he might complete the screenplay or find a sense of self-acceptance.\n15. Final Image: The final image is the last thing the reader sees and should be a reflection of the theme of the book. For example, it might show the narrator in a place of clarity and confidence, ready to embrace his future as a father and artist.",
