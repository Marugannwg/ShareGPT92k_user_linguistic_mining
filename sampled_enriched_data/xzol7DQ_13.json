      "value": "CDP's climate disclosure framework is a voluntary reporting framework that focuses specifically on climate-related risks and opportunities. It is not listed in the table above as it is not a framework developed or mandated by a regulatory body. However, CDP's framework can be used in conjunction with other reporting frameworks, such as GRI, SASB, TCFD, and IR, to provide more comprehensive reporting on an organization's climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities.\n\nCDP's climate disclosure framework is also aligned with the TCFD recommendations and can help organizations provide more detailed and standardized information on their climate risks and opportunities, which can be useful for investors, stakeholders, and decision-makers. In this sense, CDP's framework can be seen as complementary to the frameworks listed in the table above, as it provides a more focused approach to climate-related reporting.",

The ESEF format requires companies to use Inline XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) when preparing their annual reports. XBRL is a global standard for exchanging business information and has been widely adopted for financial reporting.\n\nThe proposed format for sustainability reporting under the CSRD aims to make sustainability information more comparable and accessible for investors and stakeholders, while also reducing the reporting burden on companies by using the same format for both financial and sustainability information. The specific details of the new format, such as the data points and disclosure requirements, are still being developed and will be subject to further consultation and review. The format is expected to be introduced in 2024, with reporting required from 2026 onwards.",
