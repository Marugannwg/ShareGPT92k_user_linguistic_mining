      "value": "Service quality refers to the overall level of excellence or value provided by a service in the eyes of its customers. It is a measure of how well a service meets or exceeds customer expectations. Service quality is important because it can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, business success.\n\nThe SERVQUAL model is a popular framework for measuring service quality. It was developed in the 1980s by researchers Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, and it is still widely used today. The model is based on five dimensions of service quality that customers use to evaluate services:\n\n1. Tangibles: These are the physical aspects of the service, such as the appearance of the service provider, the facilities, and the equipment.\n2. Reliability: This refers to the ability of the service provider to deliver the service as promised, consistently and accurately.\n3. Responsiveness: This refers to the willingness of the service provider to help customers and respond to their needs promptly.\n4. Assurance: This refers to the knowledge, expertise, and courtesy of the service provider, as well as their ability to inspire trust and confidence.\n5. Empathy: This refers to the degree to which the service provider understands and cares about the customer's needs and feelings.\n\nThe SERVQUAL model involves gathering data from customers on their perceptions and expectations of service quality across these five dimensions, and then using this data to identify areas where improvements can be made. By improving service quality, businesses can increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, profitability.",
