Suddenly, he hears a booming voice.\n\nPAUL BUNYAN (off-screen): Well, howdy there, partner!\n\nJohnny spins around to see a towering figure standing before him. It's Paul Bunyan, a giant of a man with a crew-cut and a stern expression.\n\nJOHNNY APPLESEED: Whoa, you're huge! Are you a giant?\n\nPAUL BUNYAN: No, sir, I'm just a big fella. Name's Paul Bunyan, pleased to make your acquaintance.\n\nJOHNNY APPLESEED: I'm Johnny Appleseed, and I'm here to plant some apple trees!\n\nPAUL BUNYAN: Well, I reckon you've come to the right place. I'm a logger, you see, and I could use some apple wood for my fires.\n\nJOHNNY APPLESEED: Apple wood? But apples are for eating, not burning!\n\nPAUL BUNYAN: That may be so, Johnny, but I've got to keep my men warm somehow.\n\nJohnny looks crestfallen.\n\nJOHNNY APPLESEED: I guess I never thought about that. I just love apples so much, I want to share them with everyone.\n\nPAUL BUNYAN: That's mighty kind of you, Johnny, but sometimes you've got to think about the bigger picture. You can't just focus on one thing all the time.\n\nJohnny looks downcast.\n\nJOHNNY APPLESEED: I guess you're right. Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone in this world, with nobody who really understands me.\n\nPAUL BUNYAN: Well, now, that's no way to think. You've got to reach out and make connections with people, Johnny. That's how you build a community.\n\nJOHNNY APPLESEED: I don't know how to do that, though. I'm not very good with people.\n\nPAUL BUNYAN: Well, I've got my own flaws, Johnny. Sometimes I can be a bit too stern and uncompromising. But I've learned that you've got to be willing to listen to others and work together to find common ground.\n\nJohnny looks up at Paul with newfound respect.\n\nJOHNNY APPLESEED: Maybe you're right. Maybe I need to start listening to others and finding ways to work together.\n\nPAUL BUNYAN: That's the spirit, Johnny! Now, let's get to planting those trees.\n\nJohnny and Paul start planting apple trees together, working side by side in the forest. As they work, they talk and laugh, and Johnny begins to feel a sense of connection to this giant of a man. For the first time in a long time, Johnny feels like he's not alone in the world.",
