      "value": "C.G. Jung: \"True love will always commit itself and engage in lasting ties; it needs freedom only to effect its choice, not for its accomplishment. Every true and deep love is a sacrifice. The lover sacrifices all other possibilities, or rather, the illusion that such possibilities exist. If this sacrifice is not made, his illusions prevent the growth of any deep and responsible feeling, so that the very possibility of experiencing real love is denied him. Love has more than one thing in common with religious faith. It demands unconditional trust and expects absolute surrender. Just as nobody but the believer who surrenders himself wholly to God can partake of divine grace, so love reveals its highest mysteries and its wonder only to those who are capable of unqualified devotion and loyalty of feeling. And because this is so difficult, few mortals can boast of such an achievement. But, precisely because the truest and most devoted love is also the most beautiful, let no man seek to make it easy. He is a sorry knight who shrinks from the difficulty of loving his lady. Love is like God: both give themselves only to their bravest knights.\"\n\nOsho, being in love: \"The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it is not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person - without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other. They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now. Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not given by the other.\"",

Jung's quote suggests that true love requires sacrifice and absolute surrender, that one needs to give up all other possibilities and be wholly devoted to their partner in order to experience real and deep love. According to Jung, love demands unconditional trust and expects absolute surrender, much like religious faith. In this view, the freedom to choose is necessary, but once the choice is made, there is no room for other options or possibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, Osho's quote suggests that the capacity to be alone is necessary for love, and that true love is not possessive or dependent on the other person. According to Osho, only those who are capable of being alone can love without becoming addicted to the other or reducing the other to a thing. In this view, love requires freedom and the ability to allow the other person absolute freedom.\n\nThus, while Jung's quote suggests that love requires sacrifice and absolute devotion, Osho's quote suggests that true love requires the ability to be alone and the willingness to allow the other person to be free. These two perspectives on love seem to be contradictory, highlighting the complexity and diversity of human experience and emotion.",

      "value": "While the two quotes offer seemingly opposing perspectives on the relationship between love and freedom, they can both be seen as complementary aspects of a broader understanding of love.\n\nIn order to truly love another person, one needs to be willing to make sacrifices and commit to a lasting relationship. This commitment is not a restriction of freedom, but rather a choice to prioritize the love and connection with the other person over other options or possibilities. However, this commitment should not be based on possession or dependence, but rather on a deep appreciation and respect for the other person's autonomy and freedom.\n\nTrue love requires both sacrifice and freedom, both devotion and respect for the other person's individuality. It is a delicate balance that requires a willingness to let go of one's own desires and expectations while also respecting the other person's choices and desires.\n\nTherefore, the capacity to be alone is not in opposition to the idea of committing to a lasting relationship. Rather, it is a recognition that true love requires a deep sense of inner freedom and independence. Only when we are capable of being alone and happy in ourselves can we enter into a relationship with another person from a place of wholeness and generosity, rather than from a place of neediness or dependence.\n\nIn summary, both quotes can be seen as offering complementary perspectives on the complex nature of love, emphasizing the importance of commitment and sacrifice, as well as the need for freedom and respect for the other person's autonomy.",
