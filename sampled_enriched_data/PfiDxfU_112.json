      "value": "CHAPTER SIX\n Geologic Forces\n From Chris\nWe have talked about a lot of specifics. Now we’d like to pull the camera back a little and put all this in a broader context. The basic point, one more time: Little, very specific things go wrong with your back at specific spots—a stressed disc, a pinched nerve, a muscle spasm. But what is really going on is that huge forces are at work on your whole body and especially on your back that manifest themselves in specific ways. And the only way you’re really going to heal your back and avoid long-term pain is to address these mega-forces at the root of your problems. \nTo open your head to the kind of thing we are talking about, think for a minute about the geologic forces that shape continents and tear mountains down to rubble. It’s astonishing, really: Relatively minor pressures, like rain and wind and a succession of freezes, literally tear down mountains. It’s hard to believe but undeniably true—hard to believe because those forces are so relatively trivial, compared to the strength of mountains. And yet, over time, they prevail. \nSo what? Well, our bodies, and especially our backs, are like that, too. Relatively minor behaviors—sitting carelessly at your computer, picking up heavy stuff with a bowed back, standing around with your head projected forward—have no impact at all, the first time. Or over a period of months, or years. Kids get away with lousy posture for a long time. But time and pressure always win. Over time—decades, say—the pressure on your back from hunching over your computer raises hell with your back. Over time, those trifling pressures from picking things up incorrectly will have you rolling on the floor. Time and pressure, “geologic pressure” on your spine, tears you down. \nOnce you get your head around that concept, you might think that we are all doomed, regardless of what we do—that the pressure of gravity alone, over decades, is going to wreck our backs no matter what. But here is the interesting thing: That’s not true. Used correctly, your body and especially your spine are built to stand up nicely to, say, 90 or even 100 years of relentless gravity and other “geological” pressures. Stand and move correctly—which is to say, with a neutral spine—and take effective steps to keep the core that holds your neutral spine in place strong, and your back will last a hundred years. That is a slightly amazing—and hugely hopeful—thing. Do stuff that’s within your control—maintain a neutral spine, keep your core strong, and don’t be stupid—and you can withstand those geological pressures for a lifetime. \nAs long as we’re focused on the big picture, let’s recognize that we are talking about two (or more) basic types of pressure on our bodies. There’s plain old gravity, which accounts for a lot. But there is also the pressure of movement. And especially regular, repetitive movement. I am talking about how we stand up or squat, how we pick things up off the floor or from the shelf. I am talking especially about the basic flexion, extension, and rotational movements, like when we swing around to reach something beside and below or above us. Or, say, how we serve in tennis. Or hit a golf ball. And—for you good kids who do serious strength training—how we actually pick up a set of weights, off the floor . . . do a sit-up or a plank.\nAnd here’s a basic insight: Gravity alone can raise holy hell with your back, if your posture is rotten. But the real killer is movement. Especially what we think of as “loaded” movement. By “loaded” we mean anything in addition to body weight, such as picking things up or lifting weights. It’s bad, for example, to twist around to pick something light off the ground if you rotate with your lower back instead of your rotating with your hips. But if you’re picking something up that weighs twenty or thirty pounds or more, the potential for harm goes up geometrically. Then add repetition and time—because you do this exercise “wrong” two days a week at the gym—then the potential for harm is enormous. Basic tip: Doing strength training “wrong” is much, much worse than not doing it at all. Some of the saddest people Jeremy, Bill, and I see—and we see them all the time—are older men and women who have been serious weight lifters for years who have been doing it wrong. And who now can barely move in an athletic or real-world way. And this is true even though they have biceps the size of softballs and quads that are scary. They can’t move! Because they have been moving wrong, heavily loaded, all their lives. Their backs are a mess, as are most of their joints; the small muscles, which weight machines do not work, have atrophied. Bill and Jeremy have saved such folks, but it can take years of corrective exercises. \nCorrect and Incorrect Lifting \n\nA B\nLet’s look at just a few movements or postures that cause problems, and then think of them in “geologic” time. (In human terms, again, that means decades.) Take a couple of simple examples (see the illustration on this page): Look at the woman in picture A, on the left. She is picking up a substantial weight, but she has good posture, including a neutral spine. And, while you can’t see it, you can assume that she has “locked down” her core to safeguard her back before she started this exercise. And her core is strong. As she rises from this position, the glutes are going to do a lot of the work, which is good. That’s what they are for. The pressures of the lift are spread evenly across the various muscles of the core and the surface of her vertebrae. She can lift weights like this—assuming that she is sane about how much weight and how many reps she does—for the rest of her life and do just fine. \nNow look at the poor person in picture B. She is just as well intentioned, and is picking up roughly the same amount of weight as the woman in picture A. But she is basically doomed. Because she is doing it with a bowed back. The pressures of the lift are directed through the spine and all on the edges. The pressure is concentrated on the edge of the disc and the vertebrae. Two things about these women. First, the woman with the neutral spine can bear 40 percent more weight than the other woman (assuming the two have identical strength and fitness). That’s a big deal. And it’s interesting: Every Olympic or otherwise serious lifter knows this and is meticulous about a neutral spine. Amateurs like you and I . . . less clear. \nBut the really big deal is what happens over time to the two of them. The woman who is lifting wrong (with a bowed back) is putting horrendously more pressure on the edges of the vertebrae and discs in her spine, and they will go bad, dramatically, in time. The other woman . . . no problem.\nThat was a dramatic example. But much less extreme behaviors, repeated over a long enough time, will have just as hellish an impact on you. Think about the basic and most common behavior, which we have talked about so much: lolling at your computer. That does not put nearly as much bad pressure on your back as weightlifting incorrectly. But time is a fine stand-in for weight. Do this behavior over a long span of time—as you now know—and you will make just as bad a mess of your back as bad lifting. Think, again, of geologic pressure. Gentle rains take longer to erode than hurricanes. But eventually the pressures are the same, and the mountain will come down. It’s the same with you: Do dumb stuff long enough, and you will be rolling on the floor. Awful. \nDo you have to be an idiot to engage in behaviors that get you in a jam? Obviously not. All of us sit carelessly at our computers more than we should. Including—in one embarrassing case I personally know about—a back-care professional whose initials are J-e-r-e-m-y J-a-m-e-s! And bear in mind that there are other bad “behaviors” so subtle that no one is going to focus on them. Think about this one: You have a touch of arthritis in one foot and it hurts, ever so slightly, at every step. Without even thinking about it you make a tiny adjustment in the way you walk, and it helps a lot. Trouble is, that tiny change also included a tiny change in the way you work your hip, and that little change was serious. You start to walk slightly differently, and now you are putting unhealthy stresses through your lower back. This is one of the most common ways to get your back misaligned, other than bad posture. Over time—over geologic time—that heedless adjustment of your foot and then your hip is going to bring you down. And you most assuredly didn’t have to be a dope to",
