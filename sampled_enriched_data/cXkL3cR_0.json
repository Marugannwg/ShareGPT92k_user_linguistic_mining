In many ways, Aunt Jo was like a second mom to me. She was always encouraging me and supporting my ambitions and dreams. She was by far, my favorite Aunt and she always meant so much to me. Then when I was 22 years old, she died. (For clarity- I am 50 years old now). My Aunt was a heavy smoker and eventually developed lung cancer that spread to her brain. No one knew what was going on. She kept having headaches and the doctors just told her that she had migraines and they treated her as such. Eventually the pain became too unbearable and they did a scan that showed that she had a mass that covered over 75% of her brain. She died 5 months later. Shortly after my aunt died, I started having dreams about her. In all of my dreams, she was still alive. In my dreams, we either were wrong about her dying, or she got better, or we found some way to bring her back. The dreams were always positive and felt good in that regard. However, when I would awake, I would forget that I had the dream. Then sometime around 1 or 2pm the following day, I would remember that I had the dream and I would realize that it was just a dream and I would realize that my aunt was still dead and it was like she had died all over again. The feelings I had were intense and I had these dreams at least once every month for the first 10 years after she had died. After those 10 years, I would have those dreams every few months until today where I really only have that dream once a year, maybe. So that is my first experience with grief that I want to share with you to remember. Do you understand? Let me know when you are ready for the second one.",

      "value": "The second experience is about my actual mom. Some background: as a single mother, my mom raised me and my sister who is 5 years younger than me. My mom and I were extremely close. In many ways, I became the man of the house especially as emotional support for my mom. She would share everything with me, we were so close. Then I graduated from High School and enlisted in the USAF and left home. My mom and I started to drift apart as I was only able to come home on holidays and vacations. Our conversations became strained and forced at times. I had always wanted to reclaim that close relationship with my mom but I basically raised my kids in a different state and had my own life with my wife and family. My mom died in 2020 quite suddenly. During the summer she had been diagnosed with cancer. However, after many tests, the doctors said that the cancer was treatable. Everyone had been praying to God that He would heal my mom and that she would pull through. When we heard that the cancer was treatable, we all rejoiced and praised God for it. When we got this good news, my mom and I were primarily talking through text. I was planning on talking to her the next week on the phone about it as I was living in New York at the time and she was living in Virginia. I texted her on Monday to see if she wanted to talk. She informed me that she had just begun her cancer treatments which were an oral method of taking some medicine. She was quite tired and said that she would talk to me the next day. She told her husband, Don (who she married and became my step-dad long after I was an adult) that she was tired and needed to get a little rest before dinner. She went into bed to rest, closed her eyes and had a heart attack and died suddenly. This was quite a shock especially since there was no prior indication of any heart issues and that she had just been giving good news concerning the cancer. I still haven't fully recovered from this situation and deal with grief concerning my mom on a regular basis. Included in that grief are feelings of remorse and regret over the relationship that I had lost with my mom and that I never got a chance to talk to her on the phone again after getting the good news about cancer. I regret that I was not there for her when she needed me and that I was not there when she died. So that is that situation. Do you understand that? Let me know when I can proceed with more information.",

You were very close to your mom while growing up, but drifted apart after you enlisted in the USAF and started your own family. In 2020, your mom was diagnosed with cancer, but the doctors said it was treatable. Everyone rejoiced and thanked God for the positive news. You communicated with your mom mainly through text at that time, and she had just started her oral cancer treatment when she suddenly passed away due to an unexpected heart attack. This loss has deeply affected you, and you still deal with grief regularly, including feelings of remorse and regret over the distance that grew in your relationship and not being there for her when she needed you or when she passed away. I understand this situation, and I'm ready for you to proceed with more information.",

The way that Linda has dealt with her grief and loss of her husband is one of the main components, strategies of the book that I will be writing. This is how Linda deals with it all: Linda goes on trips and visits places that were important to her and Don. She takes pictures and posts them on social media. She talks about the things her and Don had done and shared in the past. She even acts as if she is talking to Don saying things such as: \"Don, do you remember when we visited this place, you loved it so much! You would still love it, it hasn't changed a bit!\" Instead of wallowing in her loss and grief, she continues to celebrate her husband and their relationship through the things she does now.
