      "value": "I need to send a call for paper email to robotics-worldwide mail-list to advertise my workshop: CVPR 2023 Workshop on 3D Vision and Robotics. The information is:\nAbstract:\n3D perception is critical in robotic applications, such as manipulation and navigation. Understanding the visual world is critical for robots to operate in the real world. In recent years, we have witnessed tremendous progress in deep learning algorithms for processing and making sense of 3D data, such as segmentation and detection. These exciting developments in 3D vision have paved the ground for tackling fundamental challenges in robot perception. Furthermore, connecting 3D vision with robotics will stimulate new research opportunities in active vision, interactive perception, and vision-based decision-making. Nonetheless, a myriad of research challenges and open questions remains. To tackle these challenges, we seek to create a shared forum for interdisciplinary researchers in 3D vision and robotics to share fresh ideas and build new connections.\n\nThis workshop will provide a venue for people interested in 3D and robotics to come together to discuss the various challenges and problems in this area. This workshop will accept submissions and focus on related discussion topics such as the ones below:\n\nIs 3D useful for robotics? What kind of 3D representations are useful for robotics?\n\nHow to imbue the robot with the ability to ground language and concepts in spatial reasoning?\n\nHow can we learn robot perception from human activity data in 3D environments?\n\nHow can robots benefit from implicit neural representations (e.g., NeRF)?\n\nBoth robotics and 3D data are fields that are research areas with high barriers to entry. How can we enable researchers from other fields, such as ML, to work more easily in these areas?\n\nCall for Abstracts\nWe solicit 2-4 page extended abstracts conforming to the official CVPR style guidelines. A paper template is available in LaTeX and Word. References will not count towards the page limit. The review process is double-blind. Submissions can include: late-breaking results, under-review material, archived, or previously accepted work (please make a note of this in the submission).\n\nSubmission page: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/3DVR2023\n\nImportant Dates\n\nSubmission Deadline: March 17, 2023 (11:59 pm CST)\n\nPapers Assigned to Reviewers: March 20, 2023 (11:59 pm CST)\n\nReviews Due: April 3, 2023 (11:59 pm CST)\n\nAcceptance Decision: April 10, 2023 (11:59 pm CST)\n\nCamera-Ready Version: April 21, 2023 (11:59 pm CST)\n\nPlease note the accepted contributions will be presented as spotlight talks in the workshop, and will be posted on the workshop website upon author approval.",
