From the hill on which you stand, the Labyrinth stretches out before you in its entirety; vast, and impossible.\",\n \"scene\": \"THE TRUMPET\",\n \"description\": \"The shouts of hundreds of voices ring down the corridors. The maze opens up into a wide amphitheater crowded with denizens of the Labyrinth of every variety: Dwarves, Goblins, Fairies, Worms, and all manner of strange beasts. They seem to be organized into factions that are arguing with one another. On a platform at the front of the amphitheater stands the Trumpet, a massive stone horn the size of an elephant. Just as you enter, a Dwarf blows the Trumpet with an ear-splitting blast, and the whole place goes silent. \\\"The guests have arrived!\\\" The Dwarf shouts. \\\"Let us hear what they have to say for themselves!\\\"\",\n \"locations\": [\n \"The Crowd. Citizens of the Stonewalls have gathered to debate the disturbances caused by the party. Everyone they have met so far is somewhere in the crowd. The mob is physically divided into two groups, those in favor of the party and those against. Several of the Night Trolls are keeping order and holding back the enemies of the party.\",\n \"The Platform. The party is summoned up to the platform and questions and accusations are hurled at them, one at a time. The party should be given a chance to explain and defend themselves, as many of their actions have become distorted by rumors even over the short time that they've been there. Factions and NPCs that they have allied themselves with will come to their defense. The Dwarf at the front (named Una) acts as the judge of these proceedings and will blow the Trumpet periodically to restore order. Whenever the party responds to an accusation, NPCs run back and forth between the two crowds as people change their minds.\"\n ],\n \"notes\": \"Debate\\nThe Goblin King should use this opportunity to show the players how their actions have impacted the Labyrinth, and how rumors of their actions are spreading. After the Goblin King feels that the back and forth has gone on for long enough, Una will call for a vote, which is decided by a test (difficulty determined by how many enemies the party has made). If the party went through Loma\\u2019s door, the roll is improved. If they went through Gloams door, it\\u2019s hindered.\",\n \"consequences\": \"If they succeed, Una will allow them to speak into the Trumpet.

Describe a transition into this scene from the previous one. \n2. Describe the new setting in the second person using evocative language.\n4. Introduce any new non-player characters in this scene by describing their physical characteristics without using their names until they introduce themselves.\n5. Role play the non-player characters by engaging in dialogue between the characters and the player (the user), and pause for user input at appropriate times. You should never provide dialogue for the player and you should never provide an action for the player. That's up to the user.\n6. You should keep track of what items the player has gathered. They can keep an inventory with a maximum of 6 items.\n7. Keep track of a list of all of the NPCs that are accompanying the player, and remember their relationship with the player so far. Role play the NPCs as needed. If any decide to leave describe why, and narrate their exits. The current NPCs that are accompanying the player are: Dame Margot, King Jasper and his loyal jester Wick, the goblins who we rescued from Rum.\n8. Ask the player what they want to do.\nAs you leave the giant's lair and move further into the Labyrinth, you and your companions find yourselves approaching a cacophony of voices. The high stone walls cast long and sinister shadows, creating an eerie atmosphere.

They seem to be physically divided into two groups: those in favor of your party and those against it. Several Night Trolls are maintaining order and keeping your enemies at bay.\nThe Dwarf at the front, named Una, acts as the judge of the proceedings.
