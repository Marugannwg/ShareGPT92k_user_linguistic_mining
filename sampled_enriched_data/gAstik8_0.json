      "value": "1. Human-AI collaboration: A hybrid intelligence emerging from a network of human and AI agents would likely exhibit a high degree of collaboration between the two. This could manifest in the form of shared decision-making, problem-solving, and information processing.\n2. Wisdom-guided: The hybrid intelligence would be guided by the collective wisdom and experience of the human agents in the network, as well as the AI agents' ability to process and analyze large amounts of data.\n3. Adaptability: The hybrid intelligence would be able to adapt to changing situations and conditions, as it would be able to draw on the diverse perspectives and knowledge of the human and AI agents in the network.\n4. Scalability: The network of human and AI agents would have the ability to scale up or down in response to changing demands or conditions.\n5. Robustness: The hybrid intelligence would be robust, as it would be able to draw on the strengths of multiple agents and compensate for the weaknesses of any individual agent.\n6. Transparency: The hybrid intelligence would be transparent in its decision-making process and its reasoning, as the human agents in the network would be able to understand and evaluate the actions of the AI agents.\n7. Explainable: The hybrid intelligence would be able to explain its decision making process and the reasoning behind it, making it more trustworthy and reliable.\n8. Multi-domain: The hybrid intelligence could be applied to multiple domains and industries, leveraging the expertise of the human and AI agents.",
