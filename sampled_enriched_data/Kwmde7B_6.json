Keep it brief...sentence fragments are okay\n\nwrite the plan in this format:\n\nthe show name: Off the Bench\nstart with a a short, compelling logline sentence fragment like on a poster, not a summary of the show\nshow genre & tone & similar projects (ideally succesful ones) \na 1 sentence summary of the first season’s plot arc which covers different things than the show summary\nkey characters \nthe show's original twist: keep it short, punchy, and don't just restate the logline or first season summary\nthree compelling bullets (which can be thorough) on why this show will succeed (don’t just restate what’s already been said). \n\nPut all of the labels on their own lines with their content underneath like. \n\nTitle\nthe title\n\nincorporate these key points throughout this plan: this is a buddy cop show like you've never seen before, a brother and a sister team.
