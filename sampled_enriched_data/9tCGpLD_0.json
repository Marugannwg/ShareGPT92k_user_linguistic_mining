      "value": "based on the case studies below, generate a website idea to solve problems regarding the case studies.\n\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs), commonly known as chronic diseases,\nare health conditions that are not transmittable from person to person. Instead,\nthey result from unhealthy lifestyles and are influenced by a combination of\ngenetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioral factors. These diseases\npersist over a long period of time (normally more than 1 year) and can be critical\nto a personâ€™s health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the four\nmajor types of non-communicable diseases are cardiovascular diseases,\ncancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.\nSince 2000, the number of deaths caused by non-communicable diseases\nhas been steadily rising globally. Research indicates that non-communicable\ndiseases currently account for 74% of all deaths worldwide, claiming an average\nof 41 million lives each year. The leading cause of NCD-related deaths is\ncardiovascular diseases, with 17.9 million fatalities annually. Cancers and chronic\nrespiratory diseases also contribute significantly to NCD-related deaths, with 9.3\nmillion and 4.1 million deaths respectively, followed by diabetes, including its\nrelated kidney disease, which accounts for 2 million deaths (WHO, 2022). Non-communicable diseases are a growing concern, affecting individuals of all ages,\nnot just the late elderly. Each year, 17 million people lost their lives due to non-communicable diseases before reaching 70 years of age, with 85% of these\npremature (i.e. 30-69 years of age) deaths occurring in low- and middle-income\ncountries. The four types of non-communicable diseases mentioned earlier are\nthe main culprits for the majority of all premature NCD fatalities, accounting for\nover 80% of deaths. (WHO, 2022).\nThe heavy burden of non-communicable diseases among individuals of\nworking age results in elevated healthcare expenses, reduced work capacity, and\nfinancial instability. This unseen epidemic is a frequently overlooked source of\npoverty and impedes the economic growth of numerous countries. Its impact is\nintensifying, as the number of individuals, households, and communities affected\nis on the rise and shows no signs of slowing down. Unfortunately, the occurrence\nof premature NCD deaths is more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.\nThe major cause of this might be due to the rapidly growing population, lacking\naccess to high-quality healthcare services, practicing unhealthy lifestyles, and\npoverty. Additionally, 77% of all NCD deaths, regardless of age group, occur in\nlow- and middle-income countries. This is a concerning issue as NCDs are chronic\nin nature and demand substantial investment in terms of time and money for\ntreatment, which can result in financial strain for individuals from low and middle-income countries.\nrtunately, most non-communicable diseases are preventable. Most non-communicable diseases are caused by common, modifiable risk factors such as\ntobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets, and physical\ninactivity. By adopting healthy lifestyle habits, the community has the potential to\nprevent up to 80% of strokes, heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and over one-third\nof cancers from taking place. In conclusion, the rise of non-communicable\ndiseases is not an issue to be taken lightly, as it is the root cause of widespread\nfatalities, underlying health concerns, and weakened economic development on\na global scale, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The impact of\nthese diseases on global health is a clarion call, urging us to act swiftly and\ndecisively to prevent and take respective actions to put an end to them. To\neffectively address this growing health crisis, we must employ effective\nprevention and management strategies by utilising the existing knowledge we\nhave today to brainstorm new innovative and cost-effective solutions",
