      "value": "Dear Admissions Committee,\n\nMy interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) was sparked after reading the book \"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\" by Nick Bostrom. As I delved deeper into the subject, I realized that AI has the potential to revolutionize not only the field of technology but also a wide range of industries, including civil and transportation engineering. That realization led me to pursue a major in Civil Engineering and auxiliary degrees in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.\n\nAs a third-year undergraduate student, I am eager to take my passion for AI to the next level by participating in the Aalto Science Institute (AScI) international summer research (internship) program at Aalto University. My background in data analysis, machine learning, and AI, as well as my experience in data-driven modeling, neural network, and natural language processing, make me a strong candidate for the program. I have completed several projects that demonstrate my expertise in these areas, including a course project where I conducted an extensive data analysis on the Learning Behavior and Learning Strategies data set, of 160 students and created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize and gather insights from data. Additionally, I have worked as an AI intern at various companies, where I have automated the company’s manual data mapping using customized word embeddings and SQL, Built a neural network model that could alert and warn drivers if they feel sleepy while driving and automated the complete trading process using Kite Connect API and basic regression algorithms for prospective predictions. Currently, I am working with Professor Nagendra Rao Velaga, where I am conducting a systematic literature review for the research on effect of navigation and various in-vehicle systems on the driver.\n\nI have also had experience in systematic literature review while completing my project with Professor Ramkumar Rajendran, which would be useful for the project \"Potential of explainable AI in enhancing trust in vessel automation\" offered by the AScI program. My proficiency in SQL databases, computational coding and experience in data manipulation would be beneficial in merging different data streams into one SQL database, and understanding the typical query formats. My background in marine technology and/or ice data would be an asset in the project \"Winter navigation database creation\" offered by the AScI program.\n\nI am particularly drawn to the opportunities offered by the AScI program to participate in cutting-edge research and interact with premier research groups at Aalto University. The program's focus on internationalization and its open nature to students from all countries aligns with my goal of gaining a diverse perspective in my field of study. My research interests are focused on the application of machine learning and technologies in civil, transportation, marine and traffic engineering. I am particularly interested in the potential of explainable AI in enhancing trust in vessel automation and the winter navigation database creation projects offered by the AScI program.\n\nI am confident that my skills, experience, and interests align well with the AScI program and the projects offered, and I am eager to gain hands-on experience in my field of study. I am also looking forward to networking in an international environment and the unique summer experience in Finland. I believe that the AScI program would be an ideal platform for me to further my studies and contribute to cutting-edge research in my field. I am excited about the opportunity to participate in the Aalto Science Institute international summer research program and am confident that my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and AI, as well as my experience in data-driven modeling, neural networks, and natural language processing, make me a strong candidate for the program. Thank you for considering my application.",

However, it is yet unclear how the pandemic has altered people's\ninformation-seeking behaviour on the Web---an essential part of our lives today. We still only have a limited\nunderstanding of how these changes might have enduring effects on people's well-being, especially for socially\ndisadvantaged groups.\nThis project will quantify and understand how the lockdowns in the physical space changed people's browsing\nbehaviour on the Web and investigate whether these behavioural changes persist after the lockdown(s) were\nlifted.\nFirst, we will statistically characterise individuals' web browsing traces before, during, and after lockdowns,\nusing individual-level data. Then, we will focus our analyses of behavioural changes of different groups of\nindividuals based on: (i) socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, family status, economic status, size of\nplace of residence), and (ii) self-reported experience of the lockdown.\nRequired skills: good python programming skills and interest in the topic\nDesired skills: familiarity with data science methods and statistical models",
