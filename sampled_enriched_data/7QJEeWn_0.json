      "value": "Yes, it is possible to buy cigars in many Asian countries. There are many cigar shops and tobacconists in major cities in Asia that carry a variety of cigars. In addition, you can often find cigars for sale at luxury hotels and resorts, as well as at some high-end bars and restaurants.\n\nIt is worth noting that the availability and selection of cigars can vary widely depending on the country and region you are in. In some countries, such as China, the government places strict controls on the sale of tobacco products, including cigars, so it may be more difficult to find them. In other countries, such as Japan, cigars are more widely available and you can find a good selection at many specialty shops and tobacconists.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the price of cigars can vary widely depending on the country and the specific brand or type of cigar you are looking for. In general, you can expect to pay more for cigars in Asia than you would in the United States or Europe, due to import duties and other taxes. However, there are also many local cigar brands that are available at more affordable prices.",

There are many brands and types of cigars available at a wide range of price points, from more affordable options to premium cigars that are considered luxury items. In general, the price of a cigar is determined by a variety of factors, including the type and quality of the tobacco leaves used, the skill and craftsmanship of the person rolling the cigar, and the reputation of the brand.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the perception of cigars as luxury items is not universal and can vary widely depending on cultural and personal factors.
