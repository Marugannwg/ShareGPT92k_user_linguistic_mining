      "value": "Sure, here are some common Java interview questions along with their answers:\n\n1. What is Java?\n\nJava is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It is used for developing desktop and mobile applications, web applications, and games.\n\n1. What are the features of Java?\n\nSome of the features of Java are:\n\n* Object-oriented programming\n* Platform-independent\n* Simple and easy to learn\n* Robust and secure\n* Architecture-neutral\n* Multithreaded\n* High performance\n1. What is the difference between JDK and JRE?\n\nJDK stands for Java Development Kit, and it contains all the tools required to develop and run Java programs, including the Java compiler, debugger, and runtime environment. JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment, and it contains only the runtime environment, which is required to run Java programs.\n\n1. What is the difference between a class and an object?\n\nA class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. In other words, a class defines the properties and behavior of an object, and an object is an actual instance of that class.\n\n1. What is the difference between a static method and an instance method?\n\nA static method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an instance of the class, while an instance method belongs to the object and can be called only after creating an instance of the class.\n\n1. What is a constructor?\n\nA constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects. It is called automatically when an object is created and is used to set the initial values of the object's properties.\n\n1. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?\n\nAn abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a base class for other classes. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. An interface is a collection of abstract methods that can be implemented by any class. A class can implement multiple interfaces but can only inherit from one abstract class.\n\n1. What is the difference between a stack and a queue?\n\nA stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.\n\n1. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?\n\nAn ArrayList is a resizable array that can hold any type of objects, while a LinkedList is a doubly linked list that can also hold any type of objects. The main difference between them is the way they store the elements. In an ArrayList, the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, while in a LinkedList, the elements are stored in nodes, which are linked to each other.\n\n1. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?\n\nA checked exception is a type of exception that must be handled by the programmer at compile time, while an unchecked exception is a type of exception that can be handled at runtime. Examples of checked exceptions are IOException and ClassNotFoundException, while examples of unchecked exceptions are NullPointerException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.",

Programming Question: Create an interface named BankAccount that has methods named `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()`. Create a class named CheckingAccount that implements the BankAccount interface. The CheckingAccount class should have a variable named `balance` and a constructor that sets the initial balance to 0.\n```java\npublic interface BankAccount {\n    public void deposit(double amount);\n    public void withdraw(double amount);\n    public double getBalance();\n}\n\npublic class CheckingAccount implements BankAccount {\n    private double balance;\n    public CheckingAccount() {\n        this.balance = 0;\n    }\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        balance += amount;\n    }\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (balance - amount >= 0) {\n            balance -= amount;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Insufficient balance\");\n        }\n    }\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n}\n```\nHere are 20 additional programming questions on Java that you can practice:\n\n1. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?\n2. Can an interface extend another interface in Java?\n3. Can a class implement multiple interfaces in Java?\n4. What is the purpose of the `default` keyword in an interface method?\n5. What is a marker interface in Java?\n6. What is the purpose of the `transient` keyword in Java?\n7. What is the difference between the `==` operator and the `equals()` method in Java?\n8. What is the difference between `public`, `protected`, and `private` access modifiers in Java?\n9. What is the `static` keyword used for in Java?\n10. What is a constructor in Java?\n11. Can a constructor be private in Java?\n12. What is a singleton pattern in Java?\n13. What is the difference between a stack and a queue data structure?\n14. What is a binary search tree?\n15. What is a hash table?\n16. What is the difference between an array and a linked list?\n17. What is the difference between a checked and an unchecked exception in Java?\n18. What is the purpose of the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks in Java?\n19. What is the difference between a `NullPointerException` and an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`?\n20. What is the difference between a `HashMap` and a `TreeMap` in Java?\n\nI hope these questions and exercises will help you prepare for your Java interview. Good luck!",
