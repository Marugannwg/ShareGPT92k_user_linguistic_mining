We interviewed twenty aikido experts worldwide and performed \na qualitative content analysis of the transcribed interview data relying on NVivo \nsoftware. First, and foremost, our findings show fundamental similarities between \naikido interaction and intercultural interaction. They reveal a shared significance \nof focused interaction by consciously seeking harmony and co-creating common \nground. Second, we demonstrate that the aikido pedagogy teaches harmony and \ncommon ground through (i) multisensory learning practice and (ii) somatic dis\u0002covery by training physiological and mental tranquility. Our conclusion is that \naikido has potential as an embodied pedagogy for intercultural communication \ntraining.\n1 Introduction\nAikido is one of the martial arts practiced globally. Most martial arts stand for \ncombat. However, aikido typically stands for protecting the self, avoiding serious \ninjury to the other and seeking harmony (Friedman 2005; Kong 2016). Aikido has \nthe reputation of being a martial art with a philosophy of harmony. Moreover, \naikido practitioners see how they use the body in aikido practice “as a metaphor \nto make sense of non-martial challenges in their everyday lives” (Foster 2015). \nExperiencing your body and your self in physical practice is called embodied \npractice. \nNot much research is available on a possible link between intercultural com\u0002munication and aikido. Bannister (2018) stated that aikido is a field of practice \nAcknowledgment: The authors wish to thank the participants in this research and the reviewer \nwho contributed significant suggestions for revising the original manuscript.\n306  Greet Angèle De Baets and Ellen Van Praet\nwith valuable insights for ethical guidance in ethnobiological research involving \ncross-cultural work. Salih et al. (2022) observed and interviewed six aikido prac\u0002titioners in Dubai to study the influence of aikido practice on their professional \ncommunication in multicultural teams. They concluded that aikido could play a \nrole in both leadership training and cultural intelligence training. In his master’s \ndissertation, Husak (2012) examined how the qualities that arise from the prac\u0002tice of zen meditation and aikido might be effectively applied to interpersonal \nand intercultural interactions. \nMuch research has been conducted on cultures, cultural intelligence, inter\u0002cultural communication and intercultural training. Gudykunst and Hammer \n(1998) introduced a typology of intercultural training design in 1983 in which they \ndistinguished between didactic expository and experiential discovery. Didactic \nexpository focuses on explanations to transfer knowledge whereas experiential \ndiscovery approaches develop the emotional and behavioral dimensions of an \nindividual’s intercultural competence by e.g. discussing case studies and partic\u0002ipating in role plays (Graf 2004) or ethnographic inquiry (Díaz and Moore 2018). \nScholars who reviewed intercultural training designs argue the need for training \nmethods with experiential discovery rather than conventional didactic explana\u0002tions (Díaz and Moore 2018; Graf 2004; Treven 2003; Waxin and Panaccio 2005).\nDidactic expository divides mind and body into a dichotomy that regards the \nbody as little more than a subordinate instrument in service to the mind. Contra\u0002rily, pedagogy that joins body and mind in a physical and mental act of knowledge \nconstruction “entails thoughtful awareness of body, space, and social context” \n(Nguyen and Larson 2015: 332). This pedagogy is called embodied pedagogy and \ndraws on discovery through bodily and mental experience. Embodied pedagogy \nis, therefore, an example of an experiential training method.\nConsidering the need for more experiential intercultural training and the \nembodied practice of aikido, we examined the potential of bringing the physical \npractice of aikido into the intercultural communication classroom, emphasizing \nexperiential discovery instead of traditional didactic explanations. To investi\u0002gate aikido’s potential, we determined what principles of aikido serve intercul\u0002tural communication training by conducting a benchmarking study. Twenty \nsemistructured in-depth interviews with aikido experts from all over the world \nprovided an understanding of aikido’s core principles from a global and con\u0002temporary perspective. Previous research on aikido and its possible applications \noriginated from one aikido expert, one aikido school, one aikido style, one part of \nthe world or the twentieth century. The analysis of the twenty interviews showed \nwhat aikido experts from different parts of the world deem essential today. More\u0002over, the interview findings opened avenues to link aikido interaction with inter\u0002cultural interaction.\nHarmony and common ground: Aikido principles for intercultural training  307\nThe validation of the benchmarking study’s findings is beyond the scope of \nthis paper. A subsequent study will explore the efficiency and effectiveness of \naikido-based intercultural business communication training. Before presenting \nthe methodology and the findings of this study, we deal with the theoretical back\u0002ground and key concepts of aikido as a martial art of harmony, common ground \nin intercultural interaction and embodied pedagogy.\n2 Theoretical background and key concepts\n2.1 Aikido, the martial art of harmony\nMany publications on aikido as a martial art and its philosophy are outside aca\u0002demia, some are within academia. They often refer to the time of the founder of \naikido, Ueshiba Morihei, who passed away in 1969. John Stevens assembled and \ntranslated the secret teachings of Ueshiba. In Budo, Teachings of the Founder of \nAikido (2013), Stevens wrote how Ueshiba stated that establishing harmony is the \npurpose of true budō, which roughly translated means martial art. “True budo \nis not for the sole purpose of destroying an opponent; it is far better to defeat an \nopponent spiritually [by making him realize the folly of his actions] and then he \nwill gladly abandon his attack” (Ueshiba 2013: 35). Kenji Shimizu, one of Ueshi\u0002ba’s direct disciples, described in his book, The heavenly road (1994), that “one \nday, he [Ueshiba] realized that ‘Aikido exists beyond all those techniques and \napart from the settlement of victory or defeat.’ He understood that ‘Aikido is the \nway of harmony.’ Thus he established today’s Aikido” (Shimizu 1994: 6). Conse\u0002quently, many aikido practitioners call aikido the martial art of harmony.\nAikido is a martial art that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century \nfrom a longstanding martial culture which had transformed a system of fighting \narts, devised to inflict injury and death, into martial arts, dedicated to develop\u0002ing self-perfection by integrating mind, body, and spirit (Faggianelli and Lukoff \n2006). Aikido is a primarily weaponless, noncompetitive martial art character\u0002ized by circular movements, throws and locks applied to the joints (grappling \ntechniques involving the manipulation of an opponent’s joints, Figure 1). Today \nit is practiced globally as self-defense, as a recreational activity, as a meditative \ntechnique, as a social activity, or indeed for some as a ritual act (Niehaus 2019). \nAikido’s elaborate and effective fighting techniques and its claim to self-defense \nare subordinate to the path of nonviolence (Wagner 1999). It is for this reason \nthat in aikido an attack is not blocked but redirected. It is the principle of nonre\u0002sistance that distinguishes aikido from other martial arts (Wagner 2015). Aikido \n308  Greet Angèle De Baets and Ellen Van Praet\naims to turn opponents into partners, to build bridges even when the odds are \nagainst harmony (Ueshiba and Stevens 1993).\nFigure 1: A wrist lock in aikido (Stein 2012a).\nNote. The image shows Annette and Markus Röllig from Aikido Zentrum Offenbach e.V. \nCopyright by Dirk Stein, www.lichtwanderer.de, used with permission.\nThe physical creation of harmony in conflictual encounters is the essence of \naikido practice. It is reached by the blending of movements and breathing (Fag\u0002gianelli and Lukoff 2006). Wagner (2015) described this creation of harmony and \ncalled it attunement. First, the aikido practitioner under attack, the attackee, \nadjusts to the intensity and rhythm of the attack. Then the attackee converts it \ngradually either in the direction of deceleration to decrease the excitation and \ntension level (to calm down) or in the direction of acceleration (to disperse \nthe tension and arousal level). It is a strategy of pacing, leading and building \nrapport (Tosey and Mathison 2010). Wagner saw similarities between this strat\u0002egy and Beebe and Lachmann’s strategy (2013). Their impressive body of work \nexplained the nature of co-constructing interactions between adults and infants, \nand between therapists and patients: \n– Joining, to blend in terms of timing, rhythm, coordination and synchroniza\u0002tion.\n– Altering, to transform the other person’s state. \n– Complementing, to reciprocally complete the behavior of the other.\n“Thus, if we consider that the practice of aikido (and the practices of all other \nmartial arts as well) is a social fact, and if we want to understand how practitioners \nfind common ground on which to tactilely communicate, then martial art studies \nHarmony and common ground: Aikido principles for intercultural training  309\nwill do well to explore further the insights afforded by observing naturally-occur\u0002ring interactions” (Lefebvre 2016: 107). Lefebvre used finding common ground to \nrefer to the harmony in aikido practice or to what Wagner (2015) called attunement. \nCommon ground is not readily found in the challenge of an aikido interac\u0002tion. It is the result of conscious, deliberate action. Beebe and Lachmann (2013) \ncalled it conscious involvement. Goffman (1966) called it focused interaction. \nBoth Wagner (2015) and Lefebvre (2016) linked the respective co-constructing \nand focused interactions with aikido interactions because aikido practitioners \nfocus their attention on seeking harmony in each aikido interaction.\n2.2 Common ground in intercultural interaction\nIn intercultural interaction, the micro-level of intercultural communication, \npeople with different cultural norms and values may have a heightened chance of \nmisunderstanding, miscommunication and mismanagement (Blommaert 1998). \nWhen understanding troubles that occur in intercultural interactions, analysts \ntypically search macro-level cultural differences for a cause, without considering \nother factors, or more importantly, without examining what interlocutors might \nbe doing to overcome them (Kecskés 2018). \nInterestingly, the use of semantically transparent language results in fewer \nmisunderstandings and communication breakdowns than expected (Kecskés \n2020). Although we do not have exact figures, it is similar to what many research\u0002ers found: cultural differences do not necessarily lead to misunderstandings. In \nmost instances, no damage is done, on the contrary (Blommaert 1998). There\u0002fore, the emphasis on communication breakdowns in intercultural interaction \nis no longer considered to be a relevant approach. The fewer communication \nbreakdowns do not mean that intercultural communication is not challenging. \nIntercultural communication deals with challenging interactions in which a \nmacro-level intercultural conflict does not necessarily result in a micro-level con\u0002flict with communication breakdown. Cultures should even not be considered as \nconflicts that differentiate people. People do not have a culture; they create and \nrecreate it through text and talk (Piller 2017). Kecskés (2014), referring to Bulcean \nand Blommaert’s (Hinnenkamp 1996) and Rampton’s (Rampton 1995) data, adds \nto the definitions that culture cannot be seen as something that is ‘‘carved’’ in \nevery member of a particular society or community. In fact, culture is a manifes\u0002tation that can be changed, manipulated and dropped in interaction. \nWhen interlocutors in an intercultural situation interact, there is limited \ncommon ground. They need to co-create it in the interactional context in which \nthey are functioning at that moment. The interlocutors in intercultural interac-\n310  Greet Angèle De Baets and Ellen Van Praet\ntion are common ground creators rather than just common ground seekers and \nactivators as is the case in intracultural interaction when members of the same \nculture interact (Kecskés 2018). Kecskés (2018) explained that intercultural inter\u0002action relies more on emergent common ground because of the limited availabil\u0002ity of core common ground resulting from little or no mutual prior experience. \nCo-construction, which is the co-creation of emergent common ground, builds \nnot only on actual situational needs and context but also existing shared knowl\u0002edge and information. \nFor dealing with the challenge of intercultural interaction, Kecskés (2018) \ndefined co-created common ground as a critical component. He added a second crit\u0002ical component: conscious recipient design. “Humans have a remarkable capacity \nfor tuning their communicative behaviors to different addressees, a phenomenon \nalso known as recipient design” (Blokpoel et al. 2012: 1). Because interlocutors \nin intercultural interaction pay more attention to what is said and how it is said, \nrecipient design in intercultural interaction is more conscious (Kecskés 2018).\nFrancisco Varela, who was a renowned cognitive scientist and neuroscien\u0002tist, expressed the phenomenon of conscious recipient design and co-created \ncommon ground in the following words: “Circulation in the sense of the highly \ncomplex dialogue and reciprocal influence between two disparate communities \nthat share a new common ground” (Varela 1989: 15). Varela and other scholars \nsuch as Charles Briggs (Briggs and Hallin 2016) used circulation for the dialogue \nbetween two domains, fields or communities. The new common ground in Vare\u0002la’s definition is what Kecskés called emergent or co-created common ground. \nThe complex dialogue and reciprocal influence in Varela’s definition resemble \nKecskés’ conscious recipient design in the interaction between members of two \ncultures. The term circulation could thus denote the conscious acts of co-creating \ncommon ground and fostering recipient design in challenging interaction.",
