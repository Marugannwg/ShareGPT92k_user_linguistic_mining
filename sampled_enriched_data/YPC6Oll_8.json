Responsibility without authority\n\nExplanation: Responsibility without authority refers to a situation where an individual or group is held accountable for achieving a particular outcome or goal, but does not have the necessary authority or power to carry out the required actions. In this case, the CEO is responsible for purchasing new technology, but the board of directors has not provided the necessary budget or authority to complete the task. This can lead to frustration and inefficiency, as the CEO is unable to effectively carry out their responsibilities.\n\nOption a (authority without responsibility) would describe a situation where an individual or group has the power or authority to make decisions or take actions, but is not held accountable for the outcomes of those decisions or actions. Option c (responsibility with authority) would describe a situation where an individual or group has both the responsibility and the authority to achieve a particular outcome or goal. Option d (neither authority nor responsibility) is not applicable to the scenario presented in the question.\n\nThis question corresponds to the Application level of Bloom's Taxonomy, as it requires the application of knowledge of organizational structures and roles to a specific scenario.",

      "value": "Answer: c. Strategy formulation is creative while strategy implementation is productive.\n\nExplanation: Strategy formulation involves the creation of a strategic plan for achieving organizational goals, while strategy implementation involves putting that plan into action. Strategy formulation typically involves a smaller group of top-level executives who engage in creative and analytical thinking to come up with a plan. In contrast, strategy implementation requires a broader range of employees to work together to execute the plan and achieve the organization's goals. While both tasks require creativity and productivity, the focus of each task is different. Therefore, option c is the correct answer.\n\nOption a is incorrect because both strategy formulation and implementation involve people at different levels of the organization, although the composition of these groups may differ.\n\nOption b is incorrect because both strategy formulation and implementation require a combination of administrative and entrepreneurial skills.\n\nOption d is incorrect because both strategy formulation and implementation require a theoretical understanding of the organization and its environment.",
