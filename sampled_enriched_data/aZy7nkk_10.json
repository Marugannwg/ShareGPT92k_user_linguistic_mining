LAW OFFICE - DAY\n\nJerry's legal team and the plaintiffs' legal team are in separate rooms, conducting further research and reviewing new evidence. The celery is now only slightly high, but still making jokes about John Edwards's affair.\n\nCelery: \"I heard John Edwards tried to cover up his affair by using a wig. Ha! Get it? Cover up?\"\n\nThe baby giggles at the joke, and Apu chuckles politely.\n\nMeanwhile, in the other room, the plaintiffs' legal team is discussing their new secret witnesses and the evidence they've uncovered.\n\nDUI Guy: \"We have a witness who claims they saw Jerry making defamatory remarks about our clients in a public setting. If we can prove this, it could be a major blow to his case.\"\n\nJake: \"We've also found emails between Jerry and a comedian, in which they discuss the defamatory comments. We can use these emails to establish intent.\"\n\nKermit is on the phone with his personal trainer, talking loudly and gesturing wildly.\n\nKermit: \"I don't know what's going on. I've been training so hard, but my Fitbit is telling me I'm barely moving at all.\"\n\nBack in Jerry's room, Cochran is explaining how they can defend Jerry from the claims of defamation.\n\nCochran: \"In order to defend against defamation, we have to show that Jerry's comments were true or that he had a reasonable belief that they were true. We also have to show that the plaintiffs suffered no harm as a result of Jerry's comments.\"\n\nThe celery interrupts with another joke.\n\nCelery: \"Hey, did you guys hear about John Edwards's love child? He was born in a manger in Bethlehem. Ha! Get it? Love child, manger?\"\n\nNo one laughs this time, and the baby just stares at the celery blankly.\n\nJerry is getting more nervous as the trial date approaches.\n\nJerry: \"We need to be prepared for anything they throw at us. We need to find more evidence and shore up our case.\"\n\nApu nods in agreement.\n\nApu: \"I will continue to search for evidence on the internet, and perhaps we can find something that they missed.\"\n\nThe baby starts babbling incoherently, and the celery makes another joke.\n\nCelery: \"Hey, did you guys hear about John Edwards's mistress? She was so angry when he broke up with her that she went on a rampage at a petting zoo. Ha! Get it? Mistress, rampage, petting zoo?\"\n\nThis time, everyone groans and shakes their heads.\n\nJerry looks at his team, feeling slightly defeated.\n\nJerry: \"Let's take a break for now. We'll reconvene tomorrow and continue our research.\"\n\nThe legal teams pack up and leave the office, leaving the baby and the celery behind. The celery starts making even more jokes about John Edwards's affair, but no one is around to hear them.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.",

Jerry's team is at one table, and the plaintiffs are at another. The trial begins with opening statements. Every plaintiff speaks as part of their opening statement. Every member of the defense legal team speaks as part of their opening statement, but the celery says the most. The Celery is still high and still making jokes about John Edwards, but they are growing incredibly distasteful (but still funny). The later jokes are becoming unintelligible. Judge Ben Shapiro, who is generally hostile towards Democratic politicians like John Edwards, finds these funny. The plaintiffs give a great opening statement overall. The scene ends with Jerry worrying about the status of the case as both sides prepare to proceed with the trial the next day.",

Across the room, they see the plaintiffs and their legal team. The trial is about to begin.\n\nJERRY\n(to his team)\nOkay, everyone, we've been working hard for months to prepare for this trial. Let's do our best to defend me against these ridiculous defamation claims.\n\nJOHNNIE COCHRAN\nThat's right, Jerry. We've got a strong case and we're going to win this.\n\nBABY (gurgling)\n(translation: \"We can do this, guys!\")\n\nAPU\n(to the celery)\nYou really need to get it together, man. This is serious.\n\nCELERY\nDon't worry, guys. I've got this. I just need a little pick-me-up.\n(He pulls out a small bag of marijuana and starts rolling a joint.)\n\nMIKE TYSON\n(to the celery)\nYou better not mess this up. I didn't come all the way out here just to lose.\n\nThe judge, BEN SHAPIRO, enters the room and takes his seat.\n\nBEN SHAPIRO\n(to the courtroom)\nGood morning. We are here to begin the trial of Jerry Seinfeld vs. Kermit the Frog, the DUI guy from Cake Boss, Patrick Mahomes, Jake from State Farm, and Mr. Smith's dad.\n\nThe plaintiffs take turns giving their opening statements. Each one speaks about how Jerry defamed them and how it has negatively affected their lives.\n\nJAKE FROM STATE FARM\nYour honor, my client was simply minding his own business when Jerry Seinfeld accused him of driving under the influence. This has caused irreparable damage to his reputation.\n\nKERMIT\nJerry Seinfeld accused me of stealing his girlfriend. This is not true and it has damaged my career.\n\nPATRICK MAHOMES\nI was shocked when I read what Jerry Seinfeld said about me. I have never been involved in any scandal and this has ruined my good name.\n\nTHE DUI GUY FROM CAKE BOSS\nMy client has suffered greatly as a result of Jerry Seinfeld's false accusations. He is a respected member of the community and this has tarnished his reputation.\n\nMR. SMITH'S DAD\nI can't believe I have to be here today. Jerry Seinfeld has defamed me and my family, and it's time for him to pay for his lies.\n\nJerry's legal team takes turns giving their opening statements. The celery says the most, making jokes about John Edwards's affair.\n\nCELERY\nYour honor, my client is innocent of these baseless claims. These so-called victims are just looking for a payday. It's like they say, \"You can take the senator out of the mistress, but you can't take the mistress out of the senator.\"\n(He chuckles to himself.)\n\nJERRY\n(to the celery)\nDude, that's not even funny.\n\nBEN SHAPIRO\n(to the courtroom)\nLet's take a recess and reconvene tomorrow. We have a lot of work to do.\n\nThe courtroom empties out as the judge leaves the room. Jerry and his team huddle together.\n\nJERRY\n(to his team)\nI'm starting to get worried, guys. The plaintiffs made a pretty convincing case in their opening statements.\n\nAPU\nDon't worry, Jerry. We've got some strong evidence that we're going to present tomorrow.\n\nBABY (gurgling)\n(translation: \"Yeah, and we've got each other. We can do this together!\")\n\nMIKE TYSON\n(to the celery)\nI can't believe you made those jokes. You better",
