      "value": "Ok, to very briefly summarize: hundreds of years ago, the Spider Queen began to rise to power. Wukong and Macaque tried to take her down but failed and were captured, locked away in a hidden cell. Hundreds of years later, three human university students - Mei, MK, and Ao Lie - are trying to live semi-normal lives in the Spider Queen's kingdom, with her human cronies and spider demon minions everywhere.\n\nMK: a bold, brash young man with a devil-may-care attitude and arachnophobia.\nMei: a happy-go-lucky, confident young woman who is fiercely protective of her friends and can get comedically over-the-top at times protecting them.\nAo Lie: Mei’s cousin, a soft-spoken, clumsy young man with green eyes and long white hair\n\nAs they're at lunch one day, a group of spider demons arrest Ao Lie, saying he matches the description of a wanted rebel named Bai Long Ma. Ao Lie is interrogated and taken to an underground prison patterned after a spider's den, where he continues to protest his innocence. A spider demon bites him and injects him with venom to silence him, causing Ao Lie to get violently sick.\n\nMei and MK try to talk to the soldiers for Ao Lie’s release but make no progress - the soldiers are convinced they’ve arrested Bai Long Ma. As Mei and MK try to figure out what to do, they find a small coffeehouse with a peppermint plant growing outside. Peppermint is illegal - spiders hate the smell, as it confuses them and makes them sick - so this catches their interest. They go inside and find a young man who looks exactly like Ao Lie talking to a group of other students at a table, and realize this must be Bai Long Ma, the rebel the soldiers are hunting. Ao Lie was just unlucky enough to be mistaken for him.\n\nBai Long Ma: a young man who looks exactly like Ao Lie, but is much more confident and outgoing, and proud of his (admittedly minor) role in the rebellion.\n\nMei and MK are desperate and ask for the rebels’ help. Bai is skeptical until he sees a photo of Ao Lie and realizes they’re practically twins. He agrees to help them find and rescue Ao Lie and takes them back to a run-down building where he and a few other university students are hiding - they’d previously gotten in trouble for speaking out against Spider Queen and the rebellion took them in.\n\nFrom the headquarters, they find the prison where Ao Lie is being held. Mei and MK disguise themselves and sneak in to save him. They’re ultimately successful, as Mei breaks a tiny vial of peppermint oil - the rebels’ last resort in emergencies - to disorient the spider demon guards and give them time to escape. Ao Lie is very sick from the venom but the rebels administer antivenom and he slowly begins to recover.\n\nNow that Mei, MK, and Ao Lie are wanted fugitives, the rebellion adopts them and they flee the city to the rebellion’s main underground hideout. Ao Lie is very reluctant to go underground again, but Mei and MK support him. Ao Lie also finally meets Bai Long Ma and the two young men are amazed at how virtually identical they look. Bai mentions this might help them in the future - though Ao Lie doesn’t know how, especially since he’s so terrified of Spider Queen’s minions after his experience.\n\nAfter they’ve settled in, they join a meeting where the rebel leader, a tall, regal-looking woman, explains the plan to the gathered rebels. Everyone’s heard the story of how Wukong and Macaque tried and failed to overthrow Spider Queen and were imprisoned. Since both monkeys are immortal, the rebels believe they’re still alive and being held in the Spider Queen’s abandoned palace. They plan to rescue the monkeys and recruit them to help in the coming war.",

      "value": "A group of rebels, including MK, Mei, Bai, and Ao Lie, travel to the abandoned palace. Ao Lie has a panic attack at the sight of the spider demon guards and opts to stay in the truck, clutching a vial of peppermint oil like a security blanket. Mei, MK, and Bai sneak past the guards into the temple. There, they find a brick wall that clearly used to be a door, and suspect that this is it. They use special tools to collapse the brick wall, and sure enough, the two legendary monkeys are bound in web-like chains inside the cell. The group moves quickly to free the prisoners.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the temple, Ao Lie hears the wall collapse. The spider demon guards hear it too and begin moving to go inside. Ao Lie, still terrified but knowing he has to warn his friends, rubs peppermint oil on his face and clothes and rushes inside. The demons can’t get near him as the smell of peppermint makes them choke and get sick. Ao Lie arrives just in time to shout a warning. As the demons arrive, Wukong and Macaque fight them off and the smell of peppermint emanating from Ao Lie helps keep the others at bay. The rebels help the monkeys into a waiting truck and rush to the rebel hideout.\n\nIn the hideout, the starstruck rebels throw a huge welcome party for the monkeys. Wukong revels in the attention. Macaque quietly sips tea and enjoys his freedom. Ao Lie notices this and feels a connection with the more reserved monkey. As days pass, the two begin to have conversations and share stories of their experiences at Spider Queen’s hands. Macaque encourages Ao Lie to resist Spider Queen in spite of his fear and try methods that he can pull off - such as deception or strategy - rather than picking up a weapon and fighting directly. Ao Lie begins to consider Macaque a friend.\n\nAo Lie later has a chance to put Macaque’s advice into practice as he, Bai, Mei, and MK head into a nearby town in disguise for supplies. They’re stopped by spider demons, who recognize Bai and begin to arrest him. Ao Lie reveals himself and, taking advantage of the fact that he and Bai look identical, claims he’s the real Bai. The group then splits up, with Bai and Ao Lie running in opposite directions so the confused demons don’t know who to chase. The group eventually loses their pursuers and meets back up. They recount the story back in the rebel hideout and Macaque tells Ao Lie he’s proud of him.\n\nThe rebel leadership later holds a private meeting and includes Macaque and Wukong to discuss the plan. Afterwards, Bai gives Macaque and Wukong each their own vial of peppermint oil - each rebel carries one - and explains it’s spider demon repellent. Wukong thinks it’s hilarious that the spider demons hate peppermint so much.\n\nThat evening, Ao Lie can’t sleep. The encounter with the demons earlier in the day conjured up memories, and the underground rebel hideout doesn’t help. Macaque finds him crying and comforts him, relating his own horrific experiences with Spider Queen. Macaque reassures Ao Lie that fear is normal, shares that he has fears too, and reiterates that he’s proud of Ao Lie.\nThat's as far as I've gotten :) Now I need to get to the actual confrontation with Spider Queen.",

He vows to continue his training and to use his newfound skills to protect his people and his land.\n\nThe story ends with the rebels standing strong and united, ready to face whatever challenges may come their way.",
