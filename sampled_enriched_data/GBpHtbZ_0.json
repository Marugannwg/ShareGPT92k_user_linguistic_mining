These hotels are typically located in scenic areas with access to hot springs, such as mountainous regions or along the coast.\n\nOnsen hotels often feature traditional Japanese architecture and design, with tatami mat floors, sliding doors, and paper screens. Guest rooms are usually decorated in a simple, understated style, with futon bedding and low tables for dining or relaxing. Meals are typically served in-room or in a communal dining area, and often feature regional specialties made with fresh, seasonal ingredients.\n\nThe onsen itself is the main attraction of an onsen hotel, and many hotels have multiple baths with different temperatures and mineral compositions to suit guests' preferences. Most onsen are gender-segregated, with separate bathing areas for men and women. Bathing etiquette is important in Japanese culture, and guests are expected to follow certain rules, such as washing thoroughly before entering the onsen and not wearing swimsuits or towels in the bath.\n\nOverall, staying at an onsen hotel is a great way to experience traditional Japanese culture and relax in a beautiful, natural setting.",
