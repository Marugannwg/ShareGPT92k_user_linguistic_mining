Make an initial assessment about the type of case you’re\ninvestigating\n2. Determine a preliminary design or approach to the case\n3. Create a detailed checklist\n4. Determine the resources you need\n5. Obtain and copy an evidence drive\n6. Identify the risks\n2.2 Taking a Systematic Approach\n7. Mitigate or minimize the risks\n8. Test the design\n9. Analyze and recover the digital evidence\n10. Investigate the data you recover\n11. Complete the case report\n12. Critique the case\n2.2 Taking a Systematic Approach\nAssessing the Case\nYou can begin assessing this case as follows:\ni. Situation\nii. Nature of the case\niii. Specifics of the case\niv. Type of evidence\nv. Operating system\nvi. Known disk format\nvii. Location of evidence\n2.2 Taking a Systematic Approach\nPlanning Your Investigation\nTo investigate the Domain Name case, you should perform the\nfollowing general steps:\n1. Acquire the USB drive from Employee’s manager.\n2. Complete an evidence form and establish a chain of custody.\n3. Transport the evidence to your computer forensics lab.\n4. Place the evidence in an approved secure container.\n5. Prepare your forensic workstation.\n2.2 Taking a Systematic Approach\nPlanning Your Investigation\n6. Retrieve the evidence from the secure container.\n7. Make a forensic copy of the evidence drive (in this case, the\nUSB drive).\n8. Return the evidence drive to the secure container.\n9. Process the copied evidence drive with your computer\nforensics tools.\n2.2 Taking a Systematic Approach\nPlanning Your Investigation\n2.2 Taking a Systematic Approach\nSecuring Your Evidence\n• If the evidence for a case includes an entire computer system,\n• And associated storage media, such as floppy disks, Zip and Jaz\ncartridges, 4 mm DDS digital audio tape (DAT), and USB drivesBe flexible.\n• Some evidence is small enough to fit into an evidence bag.\n• When gathering products to secure your computer evidence,\nmake sure they are safe and effective to use on computer\ncomponents.\n• Make sure you use antistatic bags when collecting computer\nevidence.\n2.3 Procedures for Corporate High-Tech\nInvestigations\nEmployee Termination Cases\n• Incidents that create a hostile work environment, such as\n– viewing pornography in the workplace\n– sending inappropriate e-mail messages\n• Consulting with your organization’s general counsel and\nHuman Resources Department is recommended.\n2.3 Procedures for Corporate High-Tech\nInvestigations\nInternet Abuse Investigations\n• To conduct an investigation involving Internet abuse, you need\nthe following:\ni. The organization’s Internet proxy server logs\nii. Suspect computer’s IP address obtained from your\norganization’s network administrator\niii. Suspect computer’s disk drive\niv. Your preferred computer forensics analysis tool\n2.3 Procedures for Corporate High-Tech\nInvestigations\nE-mail Abuse Investigations\n An electronic copy of the offending e-mail that contains\nmessage header data;\n If available, e-mail server log records\n For e-mail systems that store users’ messages on a central\nserver, access to the server\n For e-mail systems that store users’ messages on a computer\nas an Outlook .pst or .ost file\n Your preferred computer forensics analysis tool, such as\nForensic Toolkit or ProDiscover\n2.3 Procedures for Corporate High-Tech\nInvestigations\nMedia Leak Investigations\n• In the corporate environment, controlling sensitive data can\nbe difficult.\n• To embarrass management to a rival conducting a power\nstruggle between other internal organizations.\n• Premature release of information about new products causing\nBusiness Loss.\n2.3 Procedures for Corporate High-Tech\nInvestigations\nConsider the following guidelines for media leak investigations:\n Examine e-mail, both the organization’s e-mail servers and\nprivate e-mail accounts\n Examine Internet message boards, and search the Internet for\nany information about the company or product.\n Examine proxy server logs to check for log activities\n Examine known suspects’ workstations\n Examine all company phone records\n2.4 Understanding Data Recovery\nWorkstations and Software\n• For investigation and analysis, have a specially configured PC\nknown as a forensic workstation.\n• Microsoft Windows operating system can be used.\n• Windows products are being developed that make performing\ndisk forensics easier.\n• Windows has limitations in performing disk forensics, you\nneed skills in acquiring data with MS-DOS and Linux.\n2.4 Understanding Data Recovery\nWorkstations and Software\nSetting Up Your Workstation for Computer Forensics\na) A workstation running Windows OS(Windows 10)\nb) A write-blocker device\nc) Computer forensics acquisition tool\nd) Computer forensics analysis tool\ne) A target drive to receive the source or suspect disk data\nf) Spare PATA or SATA ports\ng) USB ports\n2.5 Conducting an Investigation\nYou need the following items:\n• Original storage media\n• Evidence custody form\n• Evidence container for the storage media (evidence bag)\n• Bit-stream imaging tool\n• Forensic workstation to copy and examine the evidence\n• Secure evidence locker, cabinet, or safe\n2.5 Conducting an Investigation\nGathering the Evidence\n1. Pick up the storage media from IT Manager\n2. Fill out the evidence form, have him sign it, then sign it\nyourself.\n3. Store the storage media in an evidence bag\n4. Carry the evidence to a secure container, such as a locker,\ncabinet, or safe.\n5. Complete the evidence custody form.\n6. Secure the evidence by locking the container.\n2.5 Conducting an Investigation\nUnderstanding Bit-stream Copies\n• A bit-stream copy is a bit-by-bit copy (also known as a sector\ncopy) of the original drive or storage medium and is an exact\nduplicate.\n• A bit-stream image is the file containing the bit-stream copy of\nall data on a disk.\n• Referred as an “image,” “image save,” or “image file.”\n• Some manufacturers also refer to it as a forensic copy.\n2.5 Conducting an Investigation\nUnderstanding Bit-stream Copies\n2.5 Conducting an Investigation\nAcquiring an Image of Evidence Media\n• After you retrieve and secure the evidence, you’re ready to\ncopy the evidence media and analyze the data.\n• The first rule of computer forensics is to preserve the original\nevidence.\n• Analysis only on a copy of the data.\n2.5 Conducting an Investigation\nAnalyzing your digital evidence\n• Analyze your Digital evidence using tools like\n– ProDiscover\n– FTK Imager\n– Helix\n2.6 Completing the case\nYou need to find the answers to the following questions to write\nthe final report:\n• How did Employee’s manager acquire the disk?\n• Did Employee perform the work on a laptop, which is his own\nproperty?\n• At what times of the day was Employee using the non-workrelated files?\n• How did you retrieve that information?\n• Which company policies apply?\n• Are there any other items that need to be considered?\n2.6 Completing the case\nCritiquing the Case\n• How could you improve your performance in the case?\n• Did you expect the results you found? Did the case develop in\nways you did not expect?\n• Was the documentation as thorough as it could have been?\n• What feedback has been received from the requesting source?\n• Did you discover any new problems? If so, what are they?\n• Did you use new techniques during the case or during\nresearch?\nEnd of Chapter-2",
