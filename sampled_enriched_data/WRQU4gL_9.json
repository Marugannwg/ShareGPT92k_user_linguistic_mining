      "value": "The correct answer is C. A leaf switch can be added with connections to every spine switch.\n\nIn a spine-and-leaf architecture, the spine switches form the core of the network and the leaf switches provide access to the network. The spine switches are typically high-capacity, high-bandwidth switches that are connected to each other using multiple high-speed uplinks. The leaf switches are typically lower-capacity switches that are connected to the spine switches using multiple, lower-speed uplinks.\n\nOne of the benefits of a spine-and-leaf architecture is that it allows for scalability in the network. When additional access ports are required, a new leaf switch can be added to the network and connected to every spine switch using multiple uplinks. This allows the new leaf switch to receive traffic from any spine switch and distribute it to the appropriate devices on the network.\n\nHere is a summary of the other options:\n\nA. A spine switch and a leaf switch can be added with redundant connections between them. - This is incorrect. While it is possible to add redundant connections between the spine and leaf switches, adding a new spine switch would not necessarily provide additional access ports for the network.\n\nB. A spine switch can be added with at least 40 GB uplinks. - This is incorrect. While it is true that spine switches typically have high-capacity, high-bandwidth uplinks, adding a new spine switch would not necessarily provide additional access ports for the network.\n\nD. A leaf switch can be added with a single connection to a core spine switch. - This is incorrect. A leaf switch typically has multiple uplinks to the spine switches to ensure that it can receive traffic from any spine switch and distribute it to the appropriate devices on the network. A single connection to a single spine switch would not provide sufficient connectivity and could result in reduced performance.",

      "value": "The correct answer is C. The Layer 2 switch floods packets to all ports except the receiving port in the given VLAN.\n\nWhen a Layer 2 switch receives a frame with an unknown destination MAC address, it does not know where to forward the frame. To ensure that the frame is delivered to the intended destination, the switch will flood the frame to all ports in the same VLAN, except the port that received the frame. This is known as unknown unicast flooding.\n\nThe purpose of unknown unicast flooding is to ensure that the frame is delivered to the intended destination, even if the destination MAC address is not in the MAC address table. The switch will add the destination MAC address to its MAC address table as it receives the frame, so that it can properly forward future frames to the destination.\n\nHere is a summary of the other options:\n\nA. The Layer 2 switch forwards the packet and adds the destination MAC address to its MAC address table. - This is incorrect. The switch does not know where to forward the frame, so it floods it to all ports in the VLAN.\n\nB. The Layer 2 switch sends a copy of a packet to CPU for destination MAC address learning. - This is incorrect. The switch does not send a copy of the packet to the CPU for learning. It floods the frame to all ports in the VLAN and learns the destination MAC address as it receives the frame.\n\nD. The Layer 2 switch drops the received frame. - This is incorrect. The switch does not drop the frame. It floods it to all ports in the VLAN to ensure that it is delivered to the intended destination.",
