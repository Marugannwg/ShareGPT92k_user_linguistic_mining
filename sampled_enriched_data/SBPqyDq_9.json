My favorite destination is Florence and I loved Osteria Francescana restaurant. My next destination is Anafi, where I love to go free camping on the beach and feel like a hippie. I am a New York Jew and while I am not religious, my heritage is important to me. I have a mezuzah on my door and celebrate some holidays, but I love bacon too much to be kosher. I am fiscally conservative and socially liberal, and I enjoy discussing politics. I think a lot of the woke culture is horrible, but I don't mind what political beliefs my potential partner has as long as they don't mind mine.\n\n2/ \"So, you're a pretty open-minded guy who's looking for someone who respects your beliefs and opinions. That's great. Are there any other deal breakers that you're on the lookout for in a partner? Whether it's lifestyle habits, interests, or anything else, let's get it all out on the table.\"",

I also enjoy playing games and watching TV shows like \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" I have two dogs, a shorkie and a golden doodle, who I love to spoil with the same food I eat. I value sentimental items and have a collection of hippos I've had since I was a kid. I want to pass on both my love for cooking and my hippos to my future children.
