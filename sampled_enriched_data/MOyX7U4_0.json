His eyes are a piercing blue and he has short, spiky black hair.\n\nPower: Supporto has the ability to boost the abilities and powers of those around him. He can do this by simply touching them and focusing his energy on amplifying their abilities. He is also able to heal injuries and ailments by channeling his energy into his hands and placing them on the affected area.\n\nBackground: Supporto was a normal, average human until he was exposed to a strange energy source that gave him his powers. At first, he struggled to control his abilities, but with time and practice, he learned how to use them to help others. He decided to use his powers for good and became a superhero, using his abilities to assist and support his fellow heroes in their fight against crime and injustice.\n\nPersonality: Supporto is a kind and compassionate hero who always puts the needs of others before his own. He is fiercely loyal to those he considers friends and will do whatever it takes to protect and support them. He is also a bit of a perfectionist and can be quite serious at times, but he knows how to have fun and enjoy himself when the situation calls for it.",

They can also extend this power to other people and objects by touching them, allowing them to turn a group of people or objects invisible as well. This power allows the hero to move stealthily and go unnoticed, making them a valuable asset in covert operations and espionage.\n\nBackground: The hero discovered their power as a teenager when they stumbled upon a mysterious artifact that granted them their abilities. They have spent years learning how to control and use their powers, and have become skilled at using them for stealth and reconnaissance.\n\nPersonality: The hero is a quiet and stealthy individual who is skilled at going unnoticed. They are highly intelligent and resourceful, able to think on their feet and come up with creative solutions to problems. They are also fiercely loyal to their friends and allies and will do whatever it takes to protect and support them.",
