      "value": "It is difficult to accurately predict the population of Kowloon Walled City if it had not been demolished and continued to be developed until the present day. However, we can make an estimation based on historical data and trends.\n\nAt its peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kowloon Walled City was one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with an estimated 50,000 residents living within its 6.4-acre area. That translates to a population density of approximately 3,250,000 people per square mile.\n\nAssuming that the Walled City could maintain or even increase its population density through further development, we can consider a few scenarios:\n\n1. A conservative estimate: If the population density had remained constant since the early 1990s, the population in 2023 would be approximately the same, at around 50,000 residents.\n2. A moderate growth estimate: If the population density had increased at a moderate rate, say 1% per year, the population in 2023 would be around 50,000 \\* (1 + 0.01)^(2023-1990) ≈ 68,000 residents.\n3. A high growth estimate: If the population density had increased at a more aggressive rate, say 3% per year, the population in 2023 would be around 50,000 \\* (1 + 0.03)^(2023-1990) ≈ 120,000 residents.\n\nThese numbers are purely speculative and do not account for factors like infrastructure constraints, resource availability, and social, economic, or political changes in the region. However, they provide a rough idea of how Kowloon Walled City's population might have evolved if it had not been demolished.",

      "value": "Kowloon Walled City's extreme population density was the result of several factors, including historical, political, economic, and social influences. Some of the main factors that contributed to its high density were:\n\n1. Legal ambiguity: Kowloon Walled City existed in a unique political situation. After the British took control of the Kowloon Peninsula in 1898, the Walled City remained under Chinese jurisdiction. Over time, it evolved into a legal gray area, with neither the British colonial administration nor the Chinese government exerting effective control over it. This lack of regulation and oversight allowed the Walled City to become a haven for criminal activities, such as gambling, drug production, and prostitution, which attracted many residents.\n2. Migration and urbanization: During the 20th century, Hong Kong experienced rapid urbanization and an influx of migrants from mainland China. Many of these migrants sought affordable housing, and Kowloon Walled City offered a low-cost option due to its lack of regulation and oversight. The need for housing led to the construction of informal, cramped, and poorly built structures, which contributed to the city's high population density.\n3. Limited space: Hong Kong has a mountainous terrain, which has always placed constraints on available land for development. Kowloon Walled City was confined to a relatively small area, measuring just 6.4 acres (about 0.01 square miles). As more people moved in, the only way to accommodate them was to build vertically, resulting in closely packed high-rise structures.\n4. Informal economy: The lack of formal governance and regulation in Kowloon Walled City led to the development of a vibrant informal economy. Many residents operated small businesses, workshops, and factories within their homes, making the city a self-sustaining economic ecosystem. This attracted more people seeking employment or economic opportunities.\n5. Social networks and community: Despite its reputation for crime and squalor, Kowloon Walled City had a strong sense of community. Residents often relied on their social networks for support and assistance, which helped draw more people to the area, further increasing its population density.\n\nThese factors combined to create an environment where Kowloon Walled City became one of the most densely populated areas in the world.",

Strong sense of community: Despite the city's notorious reputation for crime, squalor, and overcrowding, residents often reported a strong sense of community and camaraderie. Neighbors relied on each other for support and assistance, and a mutual trust developed among the residents.\n2. Self-sufficiency: Given its dense population, limited resources, and lack of formal governance, one might assume that the Walled City would have been dependent on external support for its survival. However, the city developed a self-sustaining informal economy, with residents operating small businesses, workshops, and factories within their homes. There were also schools, medical clinics, and religious institutions that catered to the community's needs.\n3. Relative safety: Although Kowloon Walled City was a haven for criminal activities such as drug production, gambling, and prostitution, many residents reported feeling relatively safe within the city. The close-knit community and the absence of effective police intervention led to a unique form of self-governance, with some criminal groups providing a degree of security for the residents.\n4. Adaptability and ingenuity: The extreme population density and lack of space in the Walled City forced residents to be highly adaptable and resourceful. They ingeniously built their homes to maximize space, with structures often sharing walls and floors. They also developed intricate networks of narrow alleys, rooftop pathways, and shared communal spaces.\n5. Access to natural light and air: Despite the densely packed buildings and narrow streets, residents were able to create shared open spaces, courtyards, and rooftop gardens that allowed for natural light and air circulation. This was achieved through the adaptive use of space and the ingenuity of the residents.\n\nThese counterintuitive aspects of Kowloon Walled City illustrate the adaptability and resilience of its residents in the face of extreme living conditions.",
