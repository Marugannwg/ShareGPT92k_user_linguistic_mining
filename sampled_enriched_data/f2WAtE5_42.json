I gain new skills and weapons and gold at the special random encounters. I start with 100 lifepoints which can be reduced when I am hurt, but can be recovered with potions or resting. I lose when I have 0 lifepoints left. I win when I reach level 10000 and ascend to be a God. Announce when I win or lose and end the game. All monsters and people have levels and lifepoints. Tell me the levels and lifepoints of all monsters and people. I gain levels by winning fights. If I fight monsters or people with higher levels than mine, I risk hurting more lifepoints, but I gain more levels. My weapon and level will determine how much damage I deal. The higher the better. Show the damages dealt. Your options should consider the fact that I only have skills listed in \"Current skills\", and the items in \"Current items\".)\n\nI Choose Option 1: Set out to slay the dragon and claim its treasure.",
