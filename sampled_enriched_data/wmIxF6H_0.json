He takes a sip of whiskey and begins to speak.]\n\nDon Draper: Gentlemen, we've all heard of the term \"flying the friendly skies.\" But let me ask you, how friendly are those skies if they're not inclusive? The travel industry is changing, and we need to change with it. We need to make it clear that Jetblue Airways is committed to creating an inclusive travel experience that caters to the needs of all people.\n\n[Draper walks over to a slide projector and clicks the remote. A slide of an airplane with accessible features appears on the screen behind him.]\n\nDon Draper: Accessibility features like these are no longer optional. They're expected. We need to ensure that our planes and airport facilities cater to the needs of people with disabilities. This is not only the right thing to do, but it's also good business. By creating an accessible travel experience, we can attract a diverse customer base that shares our values.\n\n[Draper takes another sip of whiskey and walks over to a table with marketing materials. He picks up a brochure and begins to flip through the pages.]\n\nDon Draper: Our marketing materials need to reflect the diversity of our customers. We need to showcase people of all races, cultures, and abilities enjoying our services. This is not about tokenism. It's about reflecting the reality of the world we live in. By doing so, we can create a travel experience that is truly inclusive and welcoming for everyone.\n\n[Draper turns to face the executives again and takes a deep breath.]\n\nDon Draper: Gentlemen, the Fly with Equality campaign is more than just a campaign. It's a statement. A statement that Jetblue Airways is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive travel experience that caters to the needs of all people. We need to work together to make this happen, and we need to do it now. Thank you.\n\n[Draper takes one last sip of whiskey and walks out of the room as the executives look on, impressed by the pitch.]",

      "value": "Yes, some airlines have produced safety videos that are focused on accessibility, or that include accessible features to make the safety briefing more inclusive. For example:\n\n1. Air New Zealand: In 2019, Air New Zealand released a safety video called \"A Journey to Safety\" that included a section specifically focused on accessibility. The video features a Deaf activist using New Zealand Sign Language to deliver the safety briefing, as well as closed captions and audio descriptions.\n2. Virgin Atlantic: Virgin Atlantic has created a safety video that features British Sign Language interpretation, subtitles, and audio descriptions. The video is also available in an interactive version with British Sign Language interpretation, audio descriptions, and captions.\n3. Alaska Airlines: Alaska Airlines has created a safety video that features a Deaf flight attendant delivering the safety briefing in American Sign Language, with voiceover and subtitles.\n4. Qantas: Qantas has a safety video that includes an audio description track for visually impaired travelers, as well as closed captions and a sign language interpreter.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and other airlines may have similar safety videos or accessibility features. It's worth noting that accessibility should not just be limited to safety videos, but should be incorporated throughout the entire travel experience to ensure a safe and inclusive journey for all passengers.",
