      "value": "Executive Summary\n\nBeeGenius is a cutting-edge mobile application that uses visually and audibly stimulating content to promote the development of babies from birth to one year old, helping them reach their full potential. Our goal is to provide the highest quality educational content to children and families everywhere and to be a leader in the field of early childhood education.\n\nThe market for mobile education for children is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, and there is a clear demand for our solution. We plan to initially target the US market and then expand to Canada, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. Our projected revenue for the first year is $500,000, with a projected subscriber base of 10,000 users. By the end of the third year, we project to have generated $1,500,000 in revenue and reached a subscriber base of 40,000 users.\n\nOur business model is based on subscription fees, with different prices for different regions. We will charge $10 per month per child in the US, Canada and Europe, $5 per month per child in Asia and $1 per child per month for the rest of the countries.\n\nCompany Description\n\nBeeGenius is an innovative mobile application that offers a visually and audibly stimulating environment for babies. The app provides different levels of complexity based on the baby's age, providing an increasing challenge and stimulating the baby's brain. The visual stimuli are accompanied by music that is very close to classical one, and it has been designed to improve cognitive and motor skills, as well as emotional development.\n\nThe app also has a monitoring system that tracks the child's reactions, both visually (through the camera) and audibly (using the microphone). The monitoring system allows us to adapt the content to the child's age and preferences, providing a personal and effective experience.\n\nTarget Market\n\nOur target market is the parents and caregivers of babies from birth to one year old. We will reach this market through various channels, including paid Facebook and Instagram Ad campaigns, contact groups and forums of mothers and parents, and Ads through social network influencers.\n\nMarketing Plan\n\nThe marketing plan is based on three main channels: social media, influencers, and forums and contact groups. We will start by targeting the US market and then expand to other regions as the business grows.\n\nFor social media, we will use Facebook and Instagram to run targeted Ad campaigns that reach parents and caregivers of babies. The Ads will showcase the benefits of our app, and how it can help to improve their child's development.\n\nInfluencers are a powerful marketing tool, and we will use a combination of paid and organic promotions to reach our target audience. We will contact relevant influencers in the parenting and education space and offer them a commission for promoting our app.\n\nFinally, we will reach out to contact groups and forums of mothers and parents, and offer them a free trial of our app. This strategy will allow us to build trust with our target audience and create a community of satisfied customers who will help to promote our app.\n\nOperations Plan\n\nThe BeeGenius app is a simple mobile application that counts the time of the app being used from the moment of the child's birthday. The app will automatically choose content from our media content based on the child's age. The media content will be stored on YouTube, which is a free account, so we will never have to pay for storage and streaming.\n\nWe also need an AI-based set of tools for content creation, both for videos and music. We will use as many open-source AI components and models as possible to save on development time and engineers. There are ready-to-be-used",

We plan to hire these resources in Eastern Europe, as the cost of labor is relatively low. Our estimated costs for these resources are $1,000 per month for the UI/UX designer, $1,500 per month for the mobile app developer and $2,000 per month for the AI engineer.\n\nWe plan to release the MVP in 6 months from the moment we start working on the project. Our development and launch costs are estimated to be $250,000, which includes the development of the app, AI tools, and the cost of hiring the resources.\n\nWe anticipate total costs of $750,000 for the first year, which includes development costs, marketing expenses of around $10,000 per channel and the cost of the resources.\n\nFinancial Plan\n\nOur projected revenue for the first year is $500,000, with a projected subscriber base of 10,000 users. By the end of the second year, we project to have generated $1,000,000 in revenue and reached a subscriber base of 20,000 users.
