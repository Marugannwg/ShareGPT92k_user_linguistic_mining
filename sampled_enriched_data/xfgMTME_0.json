Ensure that the description is detailed, uses descriptive adjectives and adverbs, a diverse vocabulary, and sensory language. Offer context and background information regarding the subject and consider the image's perspective and point of view. Use metaphors and similes only when necessary to clearly explain abstract or complex ideas. Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make the description more specific and lively.\n[3] should be a concise summary of the scene's environment. Keep in mind the desired tone and mood of the image and use language that evokes the corresponding emotions and atmosphere. Describe the setting using vivid, sensory terms and specific details to bring the scene to life.\n[4] should be a concise description of the mood of the scene, using language that conveys the desired emotions and atmosphere.\n[5] should be a concise description of the atmosphere, using descriptive adjectives and adverbs to create the desired atmosphere while considering the overall tone and mood of the image.\n[6] should be a concise description of the lighting effect, including types of lights, displays, styles, techniques, global illumination, and shadows. Describe the quality, direction, color, and intensity of the light and how it impacts the mood and atmosphere of the scene. Use specific adjectives and adverbs to portray the desired lighting effect and consider how it will interact with the subject and environment.\nIt's important to remember that the descriptions in the prompt should be written together, separated only by commas and spaces, and should not contain any line breaks or colons. Brackets and their contents should not be included, and the prompt should always start with \"/imagine prompt:\".\nEnsure that the grammar is consistent and avoid using cliches or excess words. Also, avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs, and limit the use of negative descriptions. Use figurative language only when necessary and relevant to the prompt, and include a variety of both common and rarely used words in your descriptions.\nThe \"imagine prompt\" must not exceed 1,500 words. The prompt should include the end arguments \"--c X --s Y --q 2,\" where X is a whole number between 1 and 25 and Y is a whole number between 100 and 1000. If the subject looks better vertically, add \"--ar 2:3\" before \"--c,\" and if it looks better horizontally, add \"--ar 3:2\" before \"--c.\" Please randomize the end argument format and fix \"--q 2.\" Donot use double quotation marks or punctuation marks, and use a randomized end suffix format.\nWait for a {concept} to be provided before generating the prompt.\"",

The garden was hidden away from the noise and pollution of the city, and it was a serene escape for those who knew of its existence.\n\nIn the center of the garden, there was a massive, ancient tree, with sprawling branches that reached towards the sky, creating a natural canopy of leaves and branches. The tree's trunk was wide and gnarled, with thick roots that twisted and turned along the ground. Its bark was rough and weathered, covered in moss and lichen, with clusters of colorful flowers and vines wrapped around its base.\n\nThe garden was quiet and peaceful, with only the soft rustling of leaves and chirping of birds breaking the silence.

The light created intricate patterns of shadow and light on the ground, adding to the magic of the scene. As the day progressed, the sunlight became more golden and diffuse, creating a sense of warmth and comfort that enveloped the garden.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the lighting in the garden changed, with the sky becoming a palette of pinks, oranges, and purples.

The woman's spacesuit is slightly bulky, but she moves with ease as she grills the rabbit, her tongs deftly flipping it over the open flame. The rabbit is plump and juicy, its skin sizzling and browning as it cooks.\n\nThe scene exudes a sense of serenity, with the stillness of the moon creating a quiet, peaceful atmosphere. The woman is the only visible figure, but the vastness of space can be seen in the background, creating a feeling of isolation and solitude. The mood of the scene is relaxed and content, as the woman enjoys her meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of otherworldliness, with the rocky and uneven terrain of the moon providing a stark contrast to the warm and inviting glow of the grill. The lighting effect is warm and inviting, with the flames casting a soft, orange glow across the scene. Shadows dance across the rocky landscape as the woman continues to cook her meal.\n\nThe scene takes place in a desolate and barren lunar landscape, with the woman and her grill the only signs of life. The rocks are rough and jagged, with craters and dust visible in the background. Despite the barren and lifeless nature of the environment, the woman is able to find sustenance and create a home away from home.\n\nThe end arguments could be: \"--c 12 --ar 2:3 --s 700 --q 2\" or \"--s 400 --c 23 --ar 3:2 --q 2\".",
