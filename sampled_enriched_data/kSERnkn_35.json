This is due to the importance of enrolling enough eligible patients to meet the study's goals and ensure its validity.\n\nPatient remuneration costs can also be a significant portion of the overall budget, particularly in trials where patient participation is essential to the study's success. The compensation provided to patients is designed to incentivize participation and ensure that patients are not unduly burdened by the costs associated with participating in a trial.\n\nIn conclusion, the exact percentage of clinical trial costs allocated to recruitment and patient remuneration is highly dependent on various factors, and there is no standard or average percentage that can be applied across all trials.",
