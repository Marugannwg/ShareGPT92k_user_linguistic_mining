However, many folks would have no idea what we are talking about, so it might as well be BS to them.\nSometime the answers are so obvious and right under our nose.\nThis stuff ain't boring to those who actually want to be there.\nBy the way... you're grandfathered in for the year, as it costs $497.97 annually, to attend the masterminds.\nThese events will take place via zoom 6-12 times per year, and once every year (around summertime) we will host a major party somewhere outdoors and have a little picnic/barbecue.\nThis is a great time to mingle and get yourself in the “game” and schmooze with other like minded individuals.\nPlus let off ta little steam... which we all can use from time to time...\nThis might turn into TWO events a year depending on the group's decision to host a 2nd one... heck, maybe we'll do three.\nAnd, there will be -plenty of food and live entertainment that you won't wanna miss out on.\nThere usually , buy design, is an up-coming live act and a brand spankin' new food trailer that is showcased during these mastermind concession fairs.\nAnyway, it doesn't cost you a dime to attend since you're grandfathered in.\nStay tuned for more details.\n:)\n\n\n\nWhat the heck is an unique selling proposition (USP)?\n\nAll businesses large or small, online or offline, have competition naturally on a local and, in many cases, on a more broad national level.\nWith everything going on in today's business landscape, whichever landscape that may be for you, you will see a world where customers and consumers of all kinds are overwhelmed with options.\nNo longer is it just the local guy in the center of town peddling their goods—basically corning there market. It was during these times, probably more than 20, 30 years ago, when people could out right charge whatever they wanted for their goods and services.\nPeople today, want to quickly understand what makes YOUR product or service so special and different than another company's.\nWhen you have the right tools and know-how to position your self and your business(es) a particular way that attracts the customers you want to do business with, on your time, buying the things you sell, and setting your own prices.\nSomething to consider is when and how to stand out or blend in.\nIt is crucial, for really any business owner or entrepreneur, to fully understand and figure out how to identify a unique selling proposition, or more commonly refereed to as (USP).\nThe USP will help lay down the foundation on which you make all your futre marketing and branding decisions, that, of course, help get your more clients which make equals to more profits.\nIt's like leaving a bunch of crisp $100 bills on the table...\nWere talking double....triple...maybe even 10X the amount of business your currently getting by implementing this strategy to your business. (If you are just starting out, then you're already on the right path to success.)\nMaybe you hit a slump or plateau with the amount of sales you're getting or unhappy with the results, or even the clients that you are currently doing business with.\nThis will help solve a lot of problems for you, figuring out what the USP is for your business(es). It also happens to be something that I specialize in.\nThis whole USP business is like getting to the root of the problem...\nSome folks might find they need to redesign their whole business or stop selling a certain product or service.\nOthers may need to make very minor tweaks and adjustments to open the flood gates to success.\nThe USP is the one thing that make's your business better than the completion. It's a narrow and specific benefactor that makes your business standout among the rest of the companies trying to copy you, or are like yours.\nIn other words, why should anyone do business with you, right now, at this very moment?\nBy forming an intentional and narrow USP, you can better dial in your powerful marketing strategy that influence your ability to enhance your business message, your ads and billboards, your copywriting, your pricing, your placement, your hiring, and every other marketing decision.\nAt its core, a proper USP should instantly answer a prospect's most immediate question when they first lay their eyes on your brand's message.\nDo you know what the customer is REALLY thinking? (I bet I know)\nSo, what really makes you, your company so much better than the competition anyway?\nThe most effective USP play on the strengths and shall be based upon what makes you and your company valuable to the client.\nJust being unique, or having the “best price” is rarely going to do any justice as far as having a real USP.\nYou must differentiate and focus in on what your target market and audience really gives a hoot about.\nIf you fail doing this, your message won't be as effective and your could lose your business, become irrelevant, and go bankrupt.\nA compelling USP should be:\nAssertive, but credible and realistic – an intentional positioning for your business that smothers the competition into smithereens is a heck of a lot more profitable and memorable than the generic “give me money,” and “buy my stuff” approach, or even the classic lame message “we have the best \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.”\nValue driven customers – just being unique won't cut it and not something your target customers really give a fig about. You may like ice cream or pan cakes, but if your customer was a fish, then really its the night crawlers and crickets that will get the most bites.\nMore than just a logo, slogan or catch phrase – a logo or branding image is a great tool to help communicate your business, like a vehicle, but the USP can be seen like the fuel that keeps all the parts moving smoothly and runs throughout the veins of your entire business. Everything from the supply chain to customer service and even your return policy.\nDecommoditize your business – Nobody really wants to run their business like a giant corporate department store. Get the nagging price shoppers that annoy you to stop bugging you and your staff.\n\nAll this and more can be found at:\nhttps://justinmcdonald.biz/manifesto\nthanks for reading,\nJustin McDonald\n“Student of markets...enthusiast of wealth”",

It is the core benefit that a business offers to its target market and why customers should choose their product or service over others. A proper USP should be narrow, specific, and focused on what the target audience cares about. It should be assertive, but credible and realistic, and not just a catchy phrase or logo. A strong USP can help a business to attract more customers, increase profits, and guide their marketing decisions.",
