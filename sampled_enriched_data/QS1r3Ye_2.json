Individual and organizational aspects of openness to change were examined based on the P-O ﬁt theory. Moderated polynomial regression and response surface methodology were used for data analysis.\n\nFindings – At a higher level of communication, the congruence of openness to change between the individual and organization showed a positive ﬁt effect on learning organization. The incongruence of openness to change between individual and organization, in which the organizations’ openness to change was higher than that of individuals, decreased the level of knowledge sharing when the level of communication was higher.\n\nOriginality/value – The results of this study support the theory and practice that consideration of P-O ﬁt on openness to change and a strategic approach of communication are needed to succeed in organizational change.\n\nKeywords Person-organization ﬁt, Communication, Polynomial regression Paper type Research paper\n\nIntroduction In an environment where conditions are constantly changing and expectations are vague, organizations must be able to adapt quickly and deftly (Lewis, 2019). For an organization in higher education to be in a stable state for change, it needs to disperse its structure. Universities often are regarded as loosely coupled organizations because of their autonomous culture, but they are tightly coupled (Orton and Weick, 1990). Although university members such as faculty and administrative staff seem to be open to change, the policies and regulations of the university organization are based rigidly on a central strategy.\n\nAs an important ﬁrst step of successful change, an organization should be sensitive and open to change at different levels of the organization (Zhu and Engels, 2014). Based on person-organization ﬁt (P-O ﬁt) theory (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005), openness to change between individuals and organizations can be congruent or incongruent. Openness to change at an individual level requires a personal attitude that is ready for change based on the individual’s motivation (Choi and Ruona, 2011; Devos et al., 2007; Wanberg and Banas, 2000). Openness to change at an organizational level is based on the organizational culture and climate among the organization’s members. However, many studies have focused on either the individual or organizational level of openness to change (Choi and Ruona, 2011; Jeong et al., 2016). Thus, the perceptions on openness to change at both the individual and organizational levels, as well as their P-O ﬁt or misﬁt, need to be considered.\n\nMost research suggests that learning at the organizational level and knowledge sharing at the individual level accelerate organizational change (Park and Kim, 2018). Whether a university can respond to organizational changes based on learning and knowledge sharing can be different from the purpose of university education itself. The concept of learning organization is one of the most suitable formats of organizational culture for continued change (Watkins and Marsick, 1993; Yang et al., 2004). In addition, changes can be implemented by knowledge-sharing behaviors at an individual level. Self-motivated behavior, such as knowledge sharing, is one of the most important factors in the process of change. Depending on the P-O ﬁt of openness to change, the levels of learning organization and knowledge sharing can be perceived differently.\n\nThe current study focuses on how congruence or incongruence in openness to change between individuals and organizations inﬂuences learning organization and knowledge sharing, which are critical to successful organizational change. In addition, because communication-based organizational change is needed for efﬁcient systematic innovation (De Ridder, 2004), it is worth investigating the role of communication in accelerating or hindering change in the dynamics of organizational change. Communication can act as a reinforcing factor in P-O ﬁt or a deteriorating factor in P-O misﬁt depending on the circumstances. The primary purpose of this study is to explore the moderating role of communication in the relationship between openness to change, learning organization and knowledge sharing. Based on the results of this study, organizations such as universities need to understand P-O ﬁt and use appropriate communication strategies according to the PO ﬁt context to increase learning organization and knowledge sharing for successful organizational innovation.\n\nLiterature review Person-organization ﬁ t of openness to change An organization’s drive to change depends on its employees’ openness to change. Openness to change has been conceptualized as individuals’ attitudes that speciﬁcally form from their motivations to change (Choi and Ruona, 2011). Openness to change is a prerequisite to employee readiness for successful changes planned in an organization (Devos et al., 2007; Wanberg and Banas, 2000). An individual with a low level of openness to change considers change to be a risk and a source of anxiety (Miller et al., 1994), whereas one with a high level of openness to change perceives change as natural and a good opportunity for development (Choi and Ruona, 2011).\n\nOpenness to change needs to be viewed at both the individual and organizational levels. Many change efforts focus on system-level variables in an organization but undervalue the importance of the individual perspective on organizational change, for which people are the ones to implement changes (Devos et al., 2007). Understanding the ﬁt of openness to change between individuals and organizations helps to elucidate the underlying phenomena of organizational change. The ﬁt in values or attitudes between employees and their organization has been studied in the P-O ﬁt literature (Afsar, 2016; Kristof, 1996). P-O ﬁt of openness to change between the members and the organization is viewed as supplementary ﬁ t, which is determined by shared characteristics in values or attitudes (Kristof, 1996).\n\nP-O ﬁt can play a positive or negative role depending on an organization’s circumstances. In general, it has been argued that congruence between individuals and organizations is positive, but the level of congruence has been overlooked (Edwards, 1995). The congruence of values between individuals and organizations can be a hindrance in the process of organizational change when the levels are all low. For example, in the case of congruence with a low level of openness to change for both individuals and the organization, there will be little effort to change or innovate within an organization. To better understand P-O ﬁt of openness to change, it is important to consider the inﬂuence of various combinations of congruence or incongruence levels between individuals and organizations.\n\nPerson-organization ﬁ t of openness to change, learning organization and knowledge sharing For organizational change to be successful, a learning organization and knowledge sharing are essential. At the organizational level, as several studies have shown, learning organization is critical for innovation, supported by a collectively shared vision and ﬂexible organizational structures (Park et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2004). Learning organizations are organic and ﬂexible entities in which new ideas and approaches are welcome. An open attitude to change is a key precondition for learning organizations because it is one of the most welcoming attitudes to new ideas. Organizational members who are open to change search for new solutions to organizational issues with different methods and procedures (Kontoghiorghes et al., 2005). Openness to change in a learning organization is the process for intended organizational change. Thus, openness to change is clearly essential in a learning organization.\n\nIn terms of P-O ﬁt of openness to change, there would be two cases: high-high or low-low for congruence and high-low or low-high for incongruence. In an example of a congruence case, when individuals perceive themselves and their organizations to have a high level of openness to change, they might perceive their organization as a learning organization. However, when individuals consider both parties to have a low level of openness to change, they might not classify their organization as a learning organization.\n\nAt the individual level, knowledge sharing is at the core of creating new values in an organization for continued survival (Bock and Kim, 2002). Knowledge sharing is deﬁned as an individual’s willing behavior to share their knowledge to support other colleagues and to collaborate with others for solving problems or developing new ideas (Gibbert and Krause, 2002). By sharing knowledge that is pertinent to tasks within and between departments, new approaches can be found for long-term problems that prevent organizational change and development.\n\nMany studies have identiﬁed major factors that facilitate knowledge sharing, including individual motivation, beliefs and attitudes, as well as organizational culture and climate (Ipe, 2003; Wang and Noe, 2010). Cabrera et al. (2006) found that openness among individual attitudes is positively related to knowledge sharing. Hinds and Pfeffer (2003) argued that individuals with a high level of openness tend to have a high degree of interest in sharing their ideas and insights as well as seeking ideas and insights from others. In addition, openness within the organizational climate positively inﬂuences knowledge sharing to some degree. In sum, knowledge sharing cannot be forced by an organization and might depend on individual motivations because knowledge resides in individuals rather than in organizations (Bock et al., 2005; Hinds and Pfeffer, 2003).\n\nThe P-O ﬁt of openness to change between individuals and organizations should be considered when knowledge sharing is examined in relation to openness to change. When individuals have low levels and the organization has a high level of openness to change among P-O ﬁt cases of incongruence (i.e. high-low; low-high), the organization has a limited ability to demand that individuals share their knowledge. This is because knowledge sharing is determined primarily by individual behavior and interactions among individuals. Various interpretations of the P-O ﬁt combinations are possible to study the inﬂuence of openness to change on knowledge sharing. In sum, even if openness to change inﬂuences knowledge sharing, whether the P-O ﬁt on openness is congruent or incongruent leads to different results in the degree of knowledge sharing. A combination of congruence and incongruence for the P-O ﬁt can lead to a variety of results in which openness to change affects knowledge sharing.\n\nModerating e ﬀ ects of organizational communication Organizational communication is one of the most effective strategies for an organization to achieve a successful innovation by accepting and distributing new ideas and approaches. Organizational communication includes managerial and interpersonal forms of communication that allow members to recognize and participate in changes to policies, strategies and instructions (Gochhayat et al., 2017). When members receive quality information related to their tasks and organizational changes, they better understand change processes. Researchers have agreed that communication, such as inclusion in decision-making, is a critical component of any successful plan for organizational change (Schweiger and Denisi, 1991; Lewis and Seibold, 1998). In addition, organizational communication helps to create and share an organization’s values (Wiesenfeld et al., 1998). Therefore, the values and attitudes such as openness to change can be dispersed across the organization.\n\nBarker and Camarata (1998) asserted that all forms of organizational communication are critical in a learning organization when the environment is rapidly changing. Organizational communication helps an organization to evolve by generating insights and seeking agreement for organizational change. In an organization with active organizational communication, increasing the openness to change of individuals and organizations results in a better perception of learning organizations. In other words, the will for change is recognized more through organizational communication, through which the perception will arise that the organization is a learning organization that constantly pursues change. The perception of a learning organization can vary when the levels of openness to change between individuals and organizations are not the same. Thus, it is necessary to explore how the impact of P-O ﬁt for openness to change on the perception of a learning organization varies according to the active level of organizational communication:\n\nH1. The positive effect of congruence of openness to change on a learning organization will be stronger when there is a higher degree of organizational communication. In addition, organizational communication has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on promotion of knowledge sharing, which is critical for organizational innovation (De Vries et al., 2006; Van den Hooff and De Ridder, 2004). Knowledge sharing often is accomplished through communication between individuals or departments within an organization and the importance of knowledge sharing can be spread through communication within the organization. Research regarding knowledge sharing in the context of higher education has shown that the members’ minimal effort is revealed for knowledge transfer like innovative teaching practices (Dill, 1999) and passive forms of knowledge sharing is also shown such as using websites and databases (Treleaven et al., 2012). Nevertheless, if a university’s openness to change is shared through organizational communication, then knowledge sharing would be increased.\n\nIn turn, initiatives for sharing knowledge are important. An incongruence of openness to change between individuals and organization might bring different results than congruence when organizational communication is active. For example, when an organization’s openness is higher than that of the organizational members, active communication across the organization would discourage member knowledge sharing by revealing the organization’s force. In sum, the impact of the P-O ﬁt for openness to change on knowledge sharing should be explored according to the level of organizational communication because communication can accelerate or disrupt knowledge sharing depending on the circumstance:\n\nH2. The positive effects of congruence of openness to change on knowledge sharing will be stronger when there is a higher degree of organizational communication.\n\nFigure 1 shows the research framework based on the literature review. In our research model, openness to change congruence (or incongruence) was an input variable, whereas learning organization and knowledge sharing were the outcomes. Organizational communication was a moderating factor in the research framework.",
