I want you to prepare for practicing again and again\n[Approaches for Strengthening Human Security: A Case Study of Teachers in Selected Public Primary Schools in Three Southernmost \nProvinces of Thailand\n\nHasan Akrim Dongnadeng\n\nAbstract \n Human security means freedom from threats and violence. It occurs when individuals meet their basic needs, live with dignity, and have opportunities to improve their self-potential. Thailand's three southernmost provinces have been facing human security issues, particularly with teachers, who are a vulnerable target. Hence, this study aimed to explore approaches for strengthening the human security of teachers in selected public primary schools in the three provinces. It used a multiple case study qualitative research approach with three selected schools in three provinces' districts with the highest number of incidents and two sample groups of 42 purposefully selected respondents in total: 30 teachers and 12 school executives. The study reveals approaches to strengthening human security in three key areas: working, life and property, and social culture and participation. In terms of human security in working, teachers are encouraged to demonstrate their ability to perform tasks by offering them forums for exchange in teaching and learning innovation, promoting them with collaborative networking and student academic competitions with appropriate compensation based on their performance, advancing teachers' potential by furthering higher education or career development based on their career needs, continuously monitoring the outcome of teacher development, promoting work advancement via academic team formation for academic positions, empowering and motivating their work via reduction of teaching workload, providing an opportunity to express opinions and engage in site visits with proper feedback, and a reward-giving appropriation. Additionally, human security in life and property necessitates the development of community cooperation and a reliable information dissemination network about the area's unrest situation to serve as a preventive shield against violence. Lastly, in terms of human security in social culture and participation, it can be promoted by providing teachers with personal time away from work and encouraging them to participate in and organize various cultural and traditional activities.\n\nKeywords: Strengthening, human security, teachers, southernmost provinces of Thailand]â€‹",

Today we have Dr. Hasan Akrim Dongnadeng with us, who will present his research on \"Approaches for Strengthening Human Security: A Case Study of Teachers in Selected Public Primary Schools in Three Southernmost Provinces of Thailand\". Dr. Hasan, can you please begin your presentation?\n\nDr. Hasan: Thank you, Chairman. Human security is an essential aspect of public administration, and my research aims to explore approaches to strengthen the human security of teachers in selected public primary schools in three southernmost provinces of Thailand. These provinces have been facing human security issues, particularly with teachers, who are a vulnerable target.\n\nChairman: Can you please elaborate on the approaches you have discovered?\n\nDr. Hasan: Sure. I used a multiple case study qualitative research approach with three selected schools in three provinces' districts with the highest number of incidents and two sample groups of 42 purposefully selected respondents in total: 30 teachers and 12 school executives. The study reveals approaches to strengthening human security in three key areas: working, life and property, and social culture and participation.\n\nChairman: Can you please explain each of these key areas and the approaches that you have discovered?\n\nDr. Hasan: In terms of human security in working, teachers are encouraged to demonstrate their ability to perform tasks by offering them forums for exchange in teaching and learning innovation, promoting them with collaborative networking and student academic competitions with appropriate compensation based on their performance, advancing teachers' potential by furthering higher education or career development based on their career needs, continuously monitoring the outcome of teacher development, promoting work advancement via academic team formation for academic positions, empowering and motivating their work via reduction of teaching workload, providing an opportunity to express opinions and engage in site visits with proper feedback, and a reward-giving appropriation.\n\nChairman: That's quite comprehensive. What about human security in life and property?\n\nDr. Hasan: Human security in life and property necessitates the development of community cooperation and a reliable information dissemination network about the area's unrest situation to serve as a preventive shield against violence.\n\nChairman: And finally, what about human security in social culture and participation?\n\nDr. Hasan: Human security in social culture and participation can be promoted by providing teachers with personal time away from work and encouraging them to participate in and organize various cultural and traditional activities.\n\nChairman: Thank you, Dr. Hasan, for presenting your research. Your findings are quite insightful, and I'm sure they will be useful in promoting human security in the southernmost provinces of Thailand.",

My research focuses on the specific case of teachers in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand, but it also speaks to the broader issue of human security in the region. By identifying and addressing the challenges that teachers are facing in these provinces, we can work towards creating a safer and more secure environment for all members of the community. Additionally, the approaches that I have identified can be applied to other professions and communities facing similar challenges, which could have a positive impact on the overall human security situation in the region.\n\nChairman: That's a great point. How do you see your research contributing to the broader field of public administration?\n\nDr. Hasan: My research contributes to the field of public administration by highlighting the importance of addressing human security issues in policy and decision-making. It emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach that addresses the various dimensions of human security, such as working conditions, community engagement, and personal and professional development. Additionally, my research demonstrates the value of using a qualitative research approach to understand complex issues and develop practical solutions that can be implemented on the ground.\n\nChairman: Thank you, Dr. Hasan, for your insightful presentation and discussion.

      "value": "Chairman: Your research findings highlight the importance of addressing the working conditions of teachers to strengthen their human security. How do you suggest that policymakers and school administrators improve these conditions?\n\nDr. Hasan: One key recommendation is to provide opportunities for teachers to develop their skills and knowledge through training and professional development programs. This could include workshops on innovative teaching techniques or specialized training on topics related to the local context, such as conflict resolution or cultural sensitivity. Additionally, providing appropriate compensation based on performance and reducing teaching workload could help to motivate and empower teachers. Another recommendation is to establish academic teams for academic positions, which could provide opportunities for teachers to advance in their careers and take on leadership roles.\n\nChairman: Those are all important points. How do you suggest that policymakers and school administrators engage with the community to promote human security?\n\nDr. Hasan: One recommendation is to establish community-based initiatives to promote social cohesion and address social and cultural differences. This could include organizing community events or cultural festivals that involve teachers, students, and community members. Additionally, establishing a reliable information dissemination network about the area's unrest situation could serve as a preventive shield against violence. Policymakers and school administrators could also work with community leaders to identify local issues and develop solutions that are tailored to the specific context.\n\nChairman: Thank you, Dr. Hasan, for your valuable insights on this important topic.

      "value": "Sure, here's an example of the dialogue in table format:\n\n| Chairman | Dr. Hasan |\n| --- | --- |\n| Can you tell us about your research on approaches for strengthening human security among teachers in the southernmost provinces of Thailand? | Sure, my research used a multiple case study qualitative research approach with three selected schools in three provinces' districts with the highest number of incidents and two sample groups of 42 purposefully selected respondents in total: 30 teachers and 12 school executives. The study reveals approaches to strengthening human security in three key areas: working, life and property, and social culture and participation. |\n| Your research findings highlight the importance of addressing the working conditions of teachers to strengthen their human security. How do you suggest that policymakers and school administrators improve these conditions? | One key recommendation is to provide opportunities for teachers to develop their skills and knowledge through training and professional development programs. This could include workshops on innovative teaching techniques or specialized training on topics related to the local context, such as conflict resolution or cultural sensitivity. Additionally, providing appropriate compensation based on performance and reducing teaching workload could help to motivate and empower teachers. Another recommendation is to establish academic teams for academic positions, which could provide opportunities for teachers to advance in their careers and take on leadership roles. |\n| How do you envision the implementation of your research findings in the context of public policy and decision-making? | In terms of policy implementation, my research findings can be used to inform the development of policies and programs aimed at improving the human security of teachers in the southernmost provinces of Thailand. This could include measures to enhance the safety and security of schools and teachers, as well as initiatives to promote professional development and well-being. It could also involve community-based initiatives to address social and cultural differences and promote a culture of peace. |\n| How do you plan to disseminate your research findings to relevant stakeholders, such as policymakers, educators, and community leaders? | I plan to disseminate my research findings through various channels, including academic publications, conferences, and workshops. I also plan to engage directly with relevant stakeholders, such as policymakers, educators, and community leaders, to ensure that my research is accessible and relevant to those who can use it to create positive change. Additionally, I plan to collaborate with local organizations and networks to help facilitate the implementation of my research findings on the ground. |\n| Your research findings suggest that community engagement is important for promoting human security. How do you suggest that policymakers and school administrators engage with the community to promote human security? | One recommendation is to establish community-based initiatives to promote social cohesion and address social and cultural differences. This could include organizing community events or cultural festivals that involve teachers, students, and community members. Additionally, establishing a reliable information dissemination network about the area's unrest situation could serve as a preventive shield against violence. Policymakers and school administrators could also work with community leaders to identify local issues and develop solutions that are tailored to the specific context. |\n| Thank you, Dr. Hasan, for your valuable insights on this important topic. We appreciate your commitment to improving human security in the southernmost provinces of Thailand and look forward to seeing the impact of your research. | Thank you, Chairman. It has been a pleasure to share my research with this conference. I hope that it can contribute to positive change in the region and beyond. |",
