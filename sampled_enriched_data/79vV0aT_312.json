MK can feel him leaning heavily on him as they make their way out of the cave. He knows they have to hurry, but he also knows Macaque needs time to regain his strength before they can make a run for it.\n\nAs they exit the cave, Mei and Tang are waiting anxiously for them. They both look relieved to see Macaque standing, but their expressions quickly turn to concern as they see how weak he is.\n\n\"We need to get him somewhere safe,\" MK says, looking at his friends. \"Somewhere we can regroup and plan our next move.\"\n\nMei and Tang nod in agreement, and together, the four of them make their way out of the village and into the unknown, ready to fight for their freedom and the freedom of their people.",

He's not sure if the spell will work, but he's willing to try anything. MK starts to recite the spell and as he finishes, he points at Macaque.
