To evaluate accessibility to tourist destinations we use GIS to conduct Least-Cost-Modeling. This methodology measures the effective, rather than the Euclidian distance to tourist destination. We find that the accessibility by public transportation to tourist destinations with high global importance, specifically Christian-religious sites is relatively low. In the final part of the paper we propose a number of explanations for that.\n\n1. Introduction Jerusalem is not a particularly large city. Yet it is world renown as the holy city to the three large monotheistic religions. Jerusalem’s fame thus largely stems from the holy sites. Several additional sites, such as the Yad Vashem holocaustmemorial, add to its fame. These sites, which are also the main attractions for international tourists [1], make it a city of global importance. Concurrently, Jerusalem is a functioning city, albeit a highly contested one [2] [3]. As such it struggles with day-to-day issues such as traffic [4]. This raises the question: What is the place of the tourist sites in the planning of Jerusalem’s public transport system? While Jerusalem may seem as an extreme case, it is not unique. Many cities attract large number of tourists to various widely renowned sites within them, in many cases with religious facets [5]. Public transport systems are largely designed to address the demand of local residents. Yet, tourist flows often differ from the travel patterns of local residents, both temporally and spatially [6] [7]. Thus, the extent to which public transport systems address tourists’ demand can be hypothesized to be a function of the degree to which tourist destinations lie in proximity to travel nodes of local residents, and the extent to which it is modified to address the spatiality and temporality of tourist flows. In this paper we assess the extent to which Jerusalem’s public transport system provides accessibility to the sites that make the city globally renowned. To this end we first present a very brief overview of the relations between tourist travel pattern and urban public transport systems. Then we contextualize the “global” Jerusalem that most tourists seek within the fragmentized geography of Jerusalem. This is followed by a brief description of the current, highly segmented, public transport system in the city. In Section 4 the methodology used is described, followed by a description of the results—the extent to which various sites are accessible from the main tourist accommodations. In the final section these results are discussed, and several possible explanations are advanced for the seeming omission of major sites from the public transport map. 2. Tourist Flows and Public Transport: A Brief Overview Cities in general and polycentric cities in particular, generate a complex set of travel patterns. Most of the attention of researchers, planners and policy makers focuses on commuting and shopping related trips. Touristic-related and leisure-related travel receives far less attention [8] [9]. Commuting and shopping related travel are largely conducted in a familiar area. In contrast, tourists, and particularly international tourists, often travel in unfamiliar environments. Tourists in such unfamiliar urban settings seek to visit various attractions in a limited amount of time and often with a limited budget [10] [11]. Hence, the compatibility of the public transport system with tourists’ demands has widespread implications for tourists’ visitation experience [12] [13]. For this reason, the International Association of Public Transport stated in its directive from 2003, that the public transportation sector must adapt itself to the growing needs of tourism. If transport planners ignore tourists’ needs, the destination city may be perceived as a less welcoming attraction for tourists [14]. Ashworth and Tunbridge [15] suggest that over time there is an increasing discrepancy between the focal points of economic activity (particularly the CBD) and the historic city. As a result a discrepancy may arise between the main commuting and shopping destinations and the destinations of tourists. If the public transport system is geared mainly toward commuters’ and shoppers’ demand, it may not serve well the needs of tourists. This is the hypothesis we test for the case of Jerusalem. 3. Jerusalem as a Global Tourist City: One of the Four Cities of Jerusalem 3.1. Land Use Jerusalem is the largest city in Israel with a total population of almost 850,000 inhabitants, of which 63% are Jewish and approximately 37% are Arabs [16]. Jerusalem is hotly contested along national, ethnic and religious lines [2] [4]. Hence, political, demographic, social and religious contradictions are salient in the city's configuration [17]. Jerusalem is holy to the three main monotheistic religions, hosting many of the holiest sites for these religions. Hence Jerusalem is, from a touristic perspective, a potential world city. The number of incoming tourists to Jerusalem has generally risen, though it suffered from significant downturns after outbreaks of violence, such as the second intifada [1]. Jerusalem is highly segmented. It is actually comprised of four different “cities”: Jewish-Zionist city; Palestinian city; Jewish ultra-orthodox city and the global-tourist city. The populations of the first three “cities” have a distinctive largely segregated spatial distribution within the municipal area of Jerusalem (see Figure 1). The Arab (Palestinian) population accounts for about 35% of the population within Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries. Palestinians mostly reside in separate neighborhoods, located mainly on the east side of Jerusalem (i.e. East-Jerusalem neighborhoods). The Jewish Ultra-Orthodox accounts for about 30% of Jerusalem’s population. This group is a closed and very traditional society, living in nucleated-separate neighborhoods in order to minimize interactions with other groups of population. The Jewish-Zionist population, which includes both religious and secular Jews, accounts today for about 35% of the overall population of Jerusalem. Jewish Zionists are more scattered in space, but rarely reside in neighborhoods of the ultra-orthodox or Palestinians. As can be seen in Figure 1 tourist lodgings follow a different pattern [18]. Many of the hotels1 and hostels are located in proximity to the old city and the city center. But, there are various hostels and hotels located wider afield, that largely cater to organized groups [20]. The four cities of Jerusalem are not only segmented residentially. Each “city” has its own “city-center” as well as several sub-centers, and hence each “city” has a different travel patterns-differentiated both spatially and temporally. The three “city-centers” of Jewish-Zionists, Palestinians and Jewish ultra-orthodox populationare located within walking distance from each other, but each is largely frequented by a different group. The centers of Palestinian and Jewish ultra-orthodox activities are relatively stable. However, the Jewish-Zionists center has declined significantly over the years, as its functional elements, such as the business, government offices and commercial activities, moved out of the core of Jerusalem. As a result there are several sub-centers located in the outskirts of the city. The tourists have a less distinct center. Actually many of the main sights and attractions are located outside the commercial centers, mainly in the old city and its vicinity (see Figure 1).\n3.2. Public Transportation for the Four Cities of Jerusalem The public transportation system in Jerusalem is comprised of three partially overlapping public bus systems, representing the sectoral segmentation of the population, and one line of Light Rail Transit (LRT). The main bus system that provides services to most of the city is operated by Egged. The Egged cooperative is the largest transportation operator in Israel. In Jerusalem it operates 69 bus routes that are authorized by the Ministry of Transportation and receives state subsidies. The bus system used by the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish population includes lines on which there is illegal but de-facto segregation of men and women. In those buses men enter and exit through the front door and sit in the front of the bus, while women enter and exit through the back door and sit at the back. [21] [22]. The third bus service is the East Jerusalem bus system. This bus system is comprised of 17 different private operators that formed an association in 2002 under common livery and coordination [23] (i.e. unified logo and agreed timetable) with no common ticketing system. This system is confined to the Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem and the surrounding Palestinian metropolitan area [24]. The main shared component of the public transportation system is the LRT which currently comprises a single line stretching from the north-east to the south west of the city, passing near the old city (Figure 1). Moreover, in addition to connecting peripheral neighborhoods with the city center, it connects the three segmented “cities” of Jerusalem. Here we emphasize the LRT since it is the most visible transport artery in the city, especially for foreign tourists. Thus the LRT offers an easier way finding alternative for tourists in comparison to the complex bus network. This paper attempts to understand to what extent does Jerusalem’s public transportation system offer accessibility to the destinations that make it into a tourist world city. 3.3. Tourists and Tourism Sites in Jerusalem This paper examines the compatibility of the existing public transportation system to touristic purposes. Therefore we focus on tourists that use public transportation services. Hence, according to Cohen’s [25] [26] classification, the study differs between individual tourists and organized mass tourists who are confined to an “environmental bubble” that enables them by guided all-inclusive package tours to travel without the service of local public transportation system [27]. Specifically, this paper focuses on tourists who are not bound to a group, and who use the local public transportation system, whether they are individual mass tourists, explorers or drifters according to Cohen’s [25] [26] definitions. Overall approximately 80% of the tourists entering Israel visit Jerusalem, amounting to 1.3 to 2.4 million tourists per year since 2006. In 2015, the average number of nights in Jerusalem for non-domestic tourists was 3.4 nights, similar to the average number in 2013 and 2014, but higher than the 3.3 nights average length of stay recorded between 2007 and 2011 [28]. According to the incoming tourism survey conducted for the Israel ministry of tourism, 68% of the independent travelers, visit Jerusalem [19]. Most destinations in Jerusalem are of historic importance; many, but not all, are important for religious reasons. Several of them are of importance to more than one religion. In general, there is a distinct spatial configuration of the tourist destinations in Jerusalem. The Old City is the main tourist destination, in which many religious sites are located within walking distance (yet, topography hinders comfortable walking). Eastern Jerusalem continues to function largely as a pilgrimage and historic tourist node, as many of the Christiane religious sites are situated within it. Western Jerusalem is characterized by secular tourist sites, such as the Yad Vashem (the holocaust memorial), the Israel Museum, the Biblical zoo and Mahane Yaehuda market, as well as some religious sites (mainly Ein Karem, birthplace of John the Baptist). The tourist sites in Jerusalem may be defined according to two criteria: type and affinity. The type of attraction is defined as religious, historic or general. Affinity relates to the population who has a direct relationship with the place. For example, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is a religious site. It is sacred to Christians; hence it is defined as a Christian holy site. This does not mean that a specific tourist site attracts only those with a direct affinity; in most cases it attracts all types of tourists. Table 1 categorizes the main tourist destination in Jerusalem. Table 1 also describes the available public transport (PT) services and walking distance from the closest stations to each tourist site. Where bus is the only available mode of PT, the level of service (LOS) is also a function of the frequency of service as the frequencies differ among lines, an issue we discuss further on. \n\nSummarize the article and then write down the 10 most important highlights in the text.",
