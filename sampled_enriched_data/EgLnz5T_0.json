The size and shape of their bodies and wings make it difficult for them to generate enough lift to take off and stay aloft. However, bumblebees are able to fly due to their unique method of wing movement. Bumblebees use a figure-eight motion when flapping their wings, which allows them to generate more lift and power than would be possible with a traditional up and down wing movement. Bumblebees are also able to make quick and agile turns and changes in direction due to their ability to rotate their wings independently of one another. Scientists have studied the flight of bumblebees in order to better understand the principles of flight and to develop more efficient and agile aircraft.",

      "value": "CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is a research organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. CERN conducts research on the fundamental structure of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter. CERN is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and has a number of research facilities, including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is a particle accelerator that is used to collide protons at high energy in order to study the fundamental structure of matter.\n\nIn 2012, CERN made a number of significant scientific discoveries and advances. One of the most notable events of the year was the announcement in July that scientists at CERN had discovered a new particle that was consistent with the Higgs boson, a long-sought particle that is believed to give other particles mass. This discovery was made using data from the LHC and was announced at a press conference by CERN scientists. The discovery of the Higgs boson was considered to be a major milestone in particle physics and was widely covered in the media. Other notable achievements at CERN in 2012 included the completion of the LHC's first long shutdown for maintenance and upgrades, as well as the establishment of the Institute for Research and Innovation in Society, which is a research institute focused on the societal and economic impact of CERN's work.",
