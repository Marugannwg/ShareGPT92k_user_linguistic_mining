      "value": "Great, now that we have established a WebSocket connection between the frontend and backend, we can start implementing the game logic and chat interface.\n\nHere are some steps we can follow to implement the game logic:\n\n### 1. Define the game state\n\nWe need to define the game state and update it as players take actions. The game state should include information such as the number of players, the current round, the identities of the players, and the policy track.\n\nWe can define the game state as an object in the backend, and update it whenever a player takes an action. We can also emit a `game-update` event to broadcast the updated state to all connected clients.\n\n### 2. Implement the game logic\n\nWe need to implement the game's rules and enforce them on both the frontend and backend.\n\nFor example, we can implement the following rules:\n\n* Players take turns being the President and electing a Chancellor to pass policies.\n* The President draws three policies and discards one, then passes the remaining two policies to the Chancellor.\n* The Chancellor plays one of the two policies and discards the other.\n* If five Fascist policies are passed, the Fascists win. If six Liberal policies are passed, the Liberals win.\n* Certain player roles have special powers that can affect the game's outcome (e.g., the Investigator can investigate a player's identity).\n\nWe can implement these rules using a combination of frontend and backend logic, and update the game state accordingly.\n\n### 3. Implement the chat interface\n\nWe need to implement a chat interface where players can send messages to each other. We can use the `chat-message` event to handle chat messages.\n\nWe can create a chat box component in the frontend where players can enter and send messages. When a message is sent, the frontend will emit a `chat-message` event to the server with the message content and the sender's name. The server will then broadcast the message to all connected clients.\n\nBy following these steps, we can implement the game logic and chat interface for Secret Hitler using websockets. Of course, these are just the basics, and we can add more features and details as needed.",

      "value": "Sure, let's dive into step 1: defining the game state.\n\nThe game state is the current state of the game, including information such as the number of players, the current round, the identities of the players, and the policy track. We need to define the game state as an object in the backend and update it as players take actions.\n\nHere's an example of how we can define the game state:\n```typescript\ninterface GameState {\n  numPlayers: number,\n  currentRound: number,\n  players: Player[],\n  policyTrack: Policy[],\n  // add other properties as needed\n}\n\ninterface Player {\n  id: string,\n  name: string,\n  role: Role,\n  isDead: boolean,\n  isInvestigated: boolean\n}\n\nenum Role {\n  Liberal = 'Liberal',\n  Fascist = 'Fascist',\n  Hitler = 'Hitler'\n}\n\nenum Policy {\n  Liberal = 'Liberal',\n  Fascist = 'Fascist'\n}\n\nconst initialState: GameState = {\n  numPlayers: 0,\n  currentRound: 0,\n  players: [],\n  policyTrack: []\n  // add other properties as needed\n}\n```\nIn this example, we define a `GameState` interface that includes properties such as `numPlayers`, `currentRound`, `players`, and `policyTrack`. We also define a `Player` interface that includes properties such as `id`, `name`, `role`, and `isDead`. We use TypeScript's `enum` type to define the possible values for `Role` and `Policy`.\n\nWe can define the initial state of the game as `initialState`. We can then update the game state as players take actions. For example, when a player joins the game, we can add their information to the `players` array and update the `numPlayers` property. When policies are passed, we can add them to the `policyTrack` array and check if the game has been won.\n\nWe can also emit a `game-update` event to broadcast the updated game state to all connected clients. Clients can then update their local state and display the current state of the game to the user.",

Here are the basic steps we can follow:\n\n### 1. Electing the President and Chancellor\n\nThe game starts with a randomly selected player being the President. The President selects a player to be the Chancellor, and all other players vote on whether to approve the selection. If a majority of players approve, the selected Chancellor becomes the Chancellor for that round. If not, the next player becomes the President and selects a new Chancellor.\n\nTo implement this, we can use the `player-action` event to handle the President's selection and the `game-update` event to broadcast the updated game state. The frontend will display the list of players, and the President can select a player by clicking on their name. The backend will handle the voting logic and update the game state accordingly.\n\n### 2. Passing policies\n\nOnce the Chancellor has been elected, the President draws three policies from the policy deck and discards one. The remaining two policies are passed to the Chancellor, who selects one to play and discards the other.\n\nTo implement this, we can use the `player-action` event to handle the policy selection and the `game-update` event to broadcast the updated game state. The frontend will display the policy cards and allow the Chancellor to select one by clicking on it. The backend will handle the policy selection logic and update the game state accordingly.\n\n### 3. Winning conditions\n\nThe game is won when either five Fascist policies or six Liberal policies are passed. When a win condition is met, the game ends and a winner is declared.\n\nTo implement this, we can check the policy track in the game state after each policy is passed. If a win condition is met, we can emit a `game-over` event to broadcast the winner to all connected clients.\n\n### 4. Player roles\n\nCertain player roles have special powers that can affect the game's outcome. For example, the Investigator can investigate a player's identity, the President can peek at the next three policies, and the Chancellor can choose to veto a policy.\n\nTo implement this, we can use the `player-action` event to handle the special powers and the `game-update` event to broadcast the updated game state. The frontend will display the special power options, and the backend will handle the special power logic and update the game state accordingly.\n\nThese are just some examples of how we can implement the game logic for Secret Hitler using websockets. We can add more details and features as needed. By following these steps, we can create an interactive and engaging online version of the board game.",
