UNEP is a global organization that works to promote environmental sustainability and protect the planet. The organization focuses on a wide range of environmental issues, including climate change, biodiversity, pollution, and sustainable development.\n\nUNEP regularly publishes various reports and assessments such as the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) which assesses the state of the environment and the actions required to achieve sustainable development. These reports provide a comprehensive overview of global environmental trends, challenges and opportunities for action, but they do not rank countries in terms of their environmental solutions.\n\nDenmark is generally considered to be a leader in environmental protection and sustainable development. The country has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy, and has implemented a range of policies and initiatives to promote sustainable consumption and production. Additionally, Denmark is known for its high recycling rates, and for its green taxation system, which is aimed at reducing pollution and CO2 emissions.\n\nIn summary, UNEP does not have a ranking system for countries in terms of their environmental solutions, but Denmark is considered to be a leader in environmental protection and sustainable development, known for its ambitious targets and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote sustainable consumption and production, and its green taxation system.",
