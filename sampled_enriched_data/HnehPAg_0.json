Conclusion\n===============\n\nRecognizing signs of a healthy pregnancy is crucial for the well-being of both the mother and the baby. During the first trimester, signs of a healthy fetus include good organ formation, a normal fetal heart rate, the presence of a healthy gestational sac and placenta, and the timing of the first ultrasound.\n\nWhile there are normal symptoms of pregnancy, such as nausea and vomiting, sensitive and enlarged breasts, fatigue, digestive disturbances, and mood swings, there are also medical tests and procedures, such as prenatal blood tests, ultrasound tests, and genetic testing, that can be done to determine the health of the fetus.\n\nProper nutrition is essential for the health and development of the fetus, and pregnant women should aim to consume a balanced and healthy diet that includes necessary nutrients such as folic acid, iron, calcium, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nFetal viability, which refers to the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the womb, is typically reached between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. However, the gestational age for fetal viability can vary based on a number of factors, and regular prenatal care and check-ups are necessary for monitoring the health of both the mother and the fetus throughout pregnancy.\n\nOverall, it's important for expectant mothers to prioritize their health and seek medical attention when necessary to ensure a healthy pregnancy and a successful outcome for both mother and baby.",
