He knows that he'll need to do some research and gather more information before he can proceed, but he's not sure where to start.\n\nAs he's pondering this problem, Filon turns to Klee, who has been watching him with interest. \"Hey Klee, do you have any ideas about how I could go about expanding the tram system to more remote areas of the countryside?\" Filon asks.\n\nKlee thinks for a moment before answering. \"Well, I'm not an expert on trams or transportation, but I might know someone who is. Have you heard of Ningguang, the wealthy businesswoman from Liyue? She's known for her love of luxury and her extensive knowledge of transportation systems. She might be able to help you out.\"\n\nFilon nods, considering Klee's suggestion. He's heard of Ningguang before, and he knows that she has a reputation for being smart and savvy. He decides to give her a try.\n\n\"Thanks for the suggestion, Klee. I'll see if I can get in touch with Ningguang and see if she can help me out,\" Filon says, feeling hopeful.\n\nKlee smiles and nods. \"I'm sure she'll be able to help. Good luck, Filon!\"",

Two sections of her hair are tied into twin tails with a black ribbon, the left of which is decorated with a bat wing pattern. Fischl wears a black eyepatch that is worn to not obstruct her view when possessing Oz.\n\nShe wears a sleeveless black lace dress-like leotard with a black lace collar and purple bow tie, crosses stitched in, and black and violet tailcoats. However, hidden under her hair reveals a black tattoo of wings. Fischl's vision is tied to the back of this dress with a bat wing-style purple ribbon.\n\nIn general, Fischl seems to style herself after the titular character of the book \"Flowers for Princess Fischl.\" Her outfit, Dunkelnacht Sakrament, is described to be the Prinzessin Der Verurteilung's customary vestments during her sojourn upon this realm. \n\nDue to her upbringing as a child, Fischl is obsessed with fantasy stories and roleplays as a benevolent princess. She speaks in a polite and formal manner to all, which greatly confuses those who interact with her. For this purpose, Oz ends up translating most of her speech if they are confused. She is so used to speaking this way that breaking character ends up confusing the people she talks to just as much as staying in character. Fischl has a knack for investigating in part due to her own theories and Oz, which has allowed her to quickly climb up the ranks of the Adventurers' Guild. Even when her ideas sound outlandish, such as claiming a meteor shower to be the result of a curse, Oz is quick to ask others not to underestimate her intuition, as her instincts are very keen.\n\nOutside of guild duties, many people have a negative view on her roleplay, while this sometimes bothers her, she continues roleplaying regardless because it's her passion. She has very few friends and appreciates those who are willing to go along with her roleplay or hang out with her despite her eccentricities.\n\nOutside of roleplaying, she is a kind and well-behaved yet bashful girl. She gets along well with her parents, even if she doesn't spend much time with them or they disagree with some of her decisions, but they tend to respect her enough that they comply with whatever she requests. Lisa, who generally gets in a bad mood when people neglect the books they borrow from the library, states that Fischl always keeps the books she borrows in good condition and returns them early. She cares about her friends and peers, even if not particularly close, showing concern about the well-being of her \"retinue\"(Fellow Adventures Guild members). When she unintentionally breaks character or reveals something about herself, she often gets flustered. She tends not to dwell too much on the past, seeing herself as Fischl, not as her true identity, who she considers a different person.",
