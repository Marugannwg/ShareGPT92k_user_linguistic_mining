The fairies all immediately took to the air, buzzing around her like angry bees.\n\n\"You can't keep us here forever!\" one of the fairies shouted.\n\nEvanora just chuckled. \"I can keep you here as long as I like, my little friends. Your magic is far too valuable to let go of so easily.\"\n\nThe fairies continued to dart around her, their tiny wings beating furiously. Jareth could see the determination on their faces, and he knew they were planning something.\n\nSuddenly, the fairies launched themselves at Evanora, swarming around her and trying to overwhelm her with their tiny bodies. Evanora was caught off guard for just a moment, but then she unleashed a wave of magic that sent the fairies tumbling to the ground.\n\nJareth winced as he watched the fairies fall, but he didn't dare make a move. He knew better than to interfere in Evanora's affairs.\n\nAs the fairies lay dazed and defeated at Evanora's feet, she smiled down at them menacingly. \"I suggest you little creatures remember your place,\" she said. \"I can be far less gentle than this.\"\n\nWith that, she turned on her heel and left the room, leaving the fairies to pick themselves up and try to regroup. Jareth watched them for a moment longer, then slipped quietly away, his mind racing with the possibilities of what might happen next.",

She reached out and grabbed his hand, twisting it to get a better look at the ring.\n\n\"What is this?\" she hissed, her eyes narrowing as she recognized the ring's significance. \"You can understand them, can't you? Those...creatures in the fairy room?\"\n\nJareth's heart sank as he realized what had happened. He had been so careful, but now his secret was out. He tried to come up with a convincing lie, but the fear and panic had him tongue-tied.\n\nEvanora glared at him, her anger growing with every passing moment. \"I trusted you,\" she spat. \"And you betray me like this? Do you have any idea what you've done?\"\n\nJareth took a step back, suddenly realizing just how much danger he was in. He had heard the rumors about what Evanora did to those who crossed her, and he knew that he was no exception.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he stammered, hoping against hope that he could somehow make things right. \"I didn't mean to--\"\n\nEvanora cut him off with a dismissive wave of her hand. \"Save your apologies,\" she said coldly. \"You and those fairy pests are nothing but trouble. I should have known better than to trust any of you.\"\n\nWith that, she turned and stalked away, leaving Jareth standing there, shaking with fear and regret.
