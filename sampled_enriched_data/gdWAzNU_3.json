      "value": "It seems like you've been working on a UX design project for Async, a community-based platform that focuses on video and AVI job interview preparation for UX candidates. The research team conducted surveys and user interviews to gauge users' experiences with AVIs and their experience as UX designers in the job application process. From this research, you found that people usually had negative experiences with AVIs and going through the application process because it felt dehumanizing and raised worries about privacy concerns. Therefore, the product team decided to focus on creating a product for candidates that can create a community aspect where candidates can share how they recorded interview answers in the past as well as give feedback to others. They can also prep for upcoming AVIs with Async's interview prep library.\n\nDuring weeks 3-5, the design team started a UI kit, branding, and frequently used components library to make it easier to flesh out high fidelity designs later on in the project. In week 6, the design team ran a Google Design sprint to identify how to alleviate stress and anxiety for candidates, find out reasons why candidates might be hesitant to use AVI, and validate the idea of a 2-way interview process where candidates and hiring managers both perform AVI.\n\nYou directly contributed to the project by making the usability test/concept test plan for two-way AVIs as you wanted to remove the power differential in the hiring process between hiring managers and candidates since it seemed that candidates seemed powerless in the process and hardly had ways to interact with the company they applied to. You also helped design screens and create the prototype for the test.\n\nNow that you're on week 8, all teams are preparing to hand off the project to the phase 2 team. The updated project brief for Async Phase 1 focuses on allowing UX candidates to join a community to practice for video and AVI specific interview situations and feel more comfortable when answering UX interview questions. Async is a community-based platform that focuses on video and AVI job interview preparation for UX candidates and allows UX professionals with limited video experience to practice and record video answers to sample interview questions at their own convenience. All community members have the option to provide or receive feedback on their videos from the community or select members, which aims to alleviate anxiety and stress during interviews, specifically during video and AVIs.",

We will also document feature specifications in the form of user stories and acceptance criteria, as well as create UX deliverables such as site maps, UI kits, user task flows, and user journeys. Additionally, we will provide research and testing insights and recommendations from our continuous discovery process.\n\nOverall, our project has been focused on creating a platform that is centered around the needs of job candidates, specifically UX designers, who have had negative experiences with traditional AVIs and the hiring process in general. By conducting extensive research and testing, we have been able to identify pain points and design solutions to address them, ultimately creating a community-based platform that aims to reduce anxiety and stress during interviews and improve candidates' interviewing skills.",

By week 8, design team will hash out high fidelity screens and the final prototype according to feedback from users and the rest of the team.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was time and resource constraints. However, despite these challenges, we were all excited to volunteer our time and work together to make this project a success.\n\nOver the course of the project, we had weekly demo presentations with our client to share our progress and seek feedback. We used this feedback to refine our designs and ensure that we were creating a product that truly met our client's needs.\n\nOne of the biggest things I learned during the project was that the project brief and direction can change at any time based on new research discoveries and user feedback. This meant that we had to be flexible and willing to adapt our designs as necessary to ensure that we were creating the best possible product for our client.\n\nBy week 8, our design team had hashed out high-fidelity screens and created the final prototype based on feedback from users and the rest of the team. We iterated on what we had from our Google Design Sprint and worked on annotating the work to hand off to phase 2's project team.\n\nThroughout the project, I gained invaluable experience working as part of a team and collaborating with others to create a product that met the needs of our client. I also learned a lot about the importance of user feedback and how it can be used to drive the design process and create a product that truly meets the needs of its users.\n\nIn the end, despite the time and resource constraints, we were able to deliver a product that our client was thrilled with. It was an incredible experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of it.",
