      "value": "Real friends. They are the people who make you forget you have a phone, they make you forget about all your problems, and they make you forget about the existence of time. A real friend will always be there for you. They will take your side no matter what and will help you with any obstacle you may face. They are honest, selfless, and they are people who only want the genuine best for you. No matter what, where, or who, this attitude towards you does not change. Whether you are with them, or you are not. Whether you guys are in a gigantic crowd of people, or you guys are alone in your room. Whether you guys are out in public, or you guys are simply texting. Because in the end, real friends care about you as much as you care about them. It is a friendship that goes both ways, a friendship that is exchanged, and a friendship that is reciprocated equally. “A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow.” – William Shakespeare.\" Revise this so that the Shakespeare quote is more effectively incorporated into the paragraph.",

      "value": "Real friends are the ones who have a profound impact on our lives. They have the power to make us forget our troubles, lose track of time, and disconnect from the virtual world. These genuine companions will always stand by our side, no matter what obstacles we face. They are honest, selfless, and always have our best interests at heart. William Shakespeare once said, \"A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow.\" This quote perfectly encapsulates the essence of a true friendship, which is built on mutual understanding, respect, and support. It's a bond that remains unwavering, whether we are surrounded by a crowd or are alone in our thoughts. Real friends reciprocate our love and care, and we must cherish and nurture this special relationship to make it last a lifetime.",
