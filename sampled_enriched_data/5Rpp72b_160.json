Hire more salespeople.\nThat's a six-figure investment for the right people. You don't want to pay for them to learn.\nAnd even if you do hire more salespeople, are the ones you have truly maxed out? Are their calendars fully booked?\nProbably not.\nThe truth is, even the best sales reps hate prospecting.\nOr maybe you're on the front lines... you're deep in due diligence with sellers moving deals forward. Do you really have time to prospect effectively?\nAt Beanstalk, we understand that you want your reps in meetings, closing deals.\nWe specialize in filling calendars with qualified leads.\nWe have a proprietary capability that ensures high deliverability of emails to prospects, resulting in at least a 20% lift in meetings booked by month 2.\nThe best part? Our services are less expensive than hiring SDRs.\nDon't let prospecting hold you back from growing your business.\n\nThe Team\n\nDean Fiacco is the man behind Beanstalk, a consulting firm that specializes in demand and lead generation for companies. With over a decade of experience in fast-paced startup environments, Dean has a wealth of knowledge and a proven track record of standing up Sales & Operations best practices in startup organizations, finding their GTM strategy and footing for the first time.\nBeanstalk is uniquely equipped to take lackluster revenue results and help companies start \"cooking with gas\".\n\nWho do we work with?\nStartups\n\nService Businesses (B2B)\n\nEnterprises (B2B)\n\nSearchfunds\n\nReal Estate Investors\n\nAgencies\n\nUse some of the following text as inspiration from a competitive site called Damn Good Leads:\n\nWe book meetings for busy founders using cold email.\nYou invest $2000/month. For that you will get meetings with decision makers that are in the market for your product or service. This way we replace a $150k/year sales rep and generate a positive ROI on your investment. You don't have to manage anything.\n\nButton: I'm interested, tell me more ðŸ’¬ \nButton: I'm in, sign me up ðŸš€\n\nWhat we do\n\n\\* We find companies that exactly match your ideal customer profile and are most likely interested in your offer using our own custom software\n\\*\\* We find the contact information of the most relevant decision maker at each company and carefully verify it\n\\*\\*\\* We craft an email sequence that feels warm and gets the right people to respond\n\\*\\*\\*\\* When people respond we reply and schedule a call with you to discuss the opportunity. When they don't reply, we follow up. When they have questions, we answer them. When they have objections, we address them. \n\nWe do this all at a fraction of the cost of hiring an in-house sales team.\n\n--\n\nPlease construct the site copy with clear sections similar to the copy and outline of my initial site.
