Based on your background and experience, I believe you have a strong foundation in healthcare and a passion for helping others. However, I am unable to confirm if you are qualified for LCSW or psychiatry work, as I couldn't find information related to those specific qualifications on your profile.\n\nAt Televero Health, we have some exciting counseling and psychiatric work opportunities. If you have the required qualifications or know someone in your network who might be interested, we would greatly appreciate a referral. Please let me know if you or someone you know would be open to a quick call to discuss these opportunities further.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\nBailey",
