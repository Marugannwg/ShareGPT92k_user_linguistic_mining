These guidelines, policies and procedures are designed to promote dignity and respect, and to ensure that the needs and wishes of the deceased person and their family are met. Here's an explanation of each:\n\nNational Guidelines:\nNational guidelines are developed by professional organisations or government agencies at a national level, in the UK this could include the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), The Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and other relevant organizations. These guidelines are designed to provide evidence-based guidance on best practice for care after death. They typically cover a wide range of topics, including verification of death, care of the body, documentation, communication with the family, and legal requirements. They are developed based on the latest evidence and research, and provide a framework for consistent and high-quality care. National guidelines should be followed unless there are clear and specific reasons not to do so.\n\nLocal Policies and Procedures:\nLocal policies and procedures are developed by individual healthcare organizations, such as nursing homes or hospices, to provide guidance on how to implement the national guidelines at a local level. These policies and procedures may be specific to a particular setting or population and should be based on the latest evidence-based practice. Local policies and procedures should reflect the needs and wishes of the local population and should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that they remain relevant and effective.\n\nCare after death:\nCare after death refers to the process of caring for a person who has died and supporting their family during the bereavement process. The national guidelines and local policies and procedures cover a wide range of topics relating to care after death. These may include verification of death, care of the body, documentation, communication with the family, legal requirements, cultural and religious considerations, and environmental issues. The aim of care after death is to ensure that the deceased person is treated with dignity and respect, and that their family receives the appropriate support during this difficult time.\n\nIn summary, national guidelines, local policies and procedures are put in place to ensure that a consistent and high standard of care is provided to people who have died, and to support their families during the process of bereavement. The guidelines, policies and procedures cover a wide range of topics relating to care after death and are designed to promote dignity and respect for the deceased person and their family.",

Agreed ways of working in relation to this may include the following:\n\n1. Personal protective equipment (PPE): Healthcare professionals should use appropriate PPE, such as gloves and aprons, when handling the deceased person, to prevent the spread of infection.\n2. Hand hygiene: Healthcare professionals should perform hand hygiene, such as washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, before and after handling the deceased person to prevent the spread of infection.\n3. Cleaning and disinfection: All equipment and surfaces that have been in contact with the deceased person should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected using appropriate cleaning products to prevent the spread of infection.\n4. Transport: The transportation of the deceased person should be carried out in a safe and appropriate manner. The body should be placed in a suitable bag or container to prevent the spread of infection, and the vehicle used for transportation should be appropriately cleaned and disinfected before and after use.\n5. Documentation: Accurate documentation of all care provided to the deceased person should be maintained. This includes details of any infection prevention and control measures taken, such as PPE used, cleaning and disinfection, and transport.\n\nIn addition to these measures, healthcare professionals should follow any specific local policies and procedures that are in place to prevent and control infection when caring for and transferring a deceased person. This may include additional measures such as the use of designated areas for handling the deceased person or the involvement of specialist infection control teams.\n\nOverall, agreed ways of working relating to prevention and control of infection when caring for and transferring a deceased person are essential to prevent the spread of infection and maintain a safe and hygienic environment for all involved in the care of the deceased person.",
