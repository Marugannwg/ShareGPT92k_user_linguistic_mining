Deceptive phishing: In this type of attack, the attacker creates a fake email or website that appears to be from a legitimate source such as a bank or other financial institution, and lures the victim into providing sensitive information like login credentials, credit card details, etc. The impact can be severe, as the attacker can gain access to the victim's financial accounts and steal money. The attack flow involves the attacker sending out phishing emails or directing the victim to a fake website, which then prompts the victim to enter their personal information.\n2. Spear phishing: In this type of attack, the attacker targets a specific individual or group of individuals, usually with a high level of authority or access to sensitive information, by crafting personalized messages that appear to be from a trusted source. The impact can be severe as the attacker can gain access to sensitive information or systems. The attack flow involves the attacker gathering information about the target through various means such as social media, company directories, etc., and then crafting a convincing message to deceive the victim.\n3.

The impact can be severe, as the attacker can gain access to sensitive information, such as financial records, strategic plans, and proprietary data. The attack flow is similar to spear phishing but requires more research and preparation to create a convincing message that would appeal to a high-level executive.\n4.

The impact can be severe, as the attacker can gain access to the victim's financial accounts and steal money. The attack flow involves the attacker compromising the victim's computer or network, changing DNS records, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the victim's browser.\n5. Smishing: This type of attack uses SMS messages to trick the victim into downloading malware or providing sensitive information. The impact can be severe, as the attacker can gain access to the victim's mobile device and steal personal information or install malware. The attack flow involves the attacker sending a convincing SMS message to the victim, which contains a link or a request for information.\n6. Vishing: This type of attack uses voice messages or phone calls to trick the victim into providing sensitive information or transferring money. The impact can be severe, as the attacker can gain access to the victim's financial accounts and steal money. The attack flow involves the attacker posing as a legitimate authority, such as a bank representative, and convincing the victim to provide sensitive information over the phone.\n7. Angler phishing: This type of attack targets social media users by creating fake profiles and sending friend requests or messages that contain links to malicious websites. The impact can be severe, as the attacker can gain access to the victim's social media accounts and steal personal information or install malware. The attack flow involves the attacker creating a fake profile, building credibility, and then sending links to malicious websites through messages or friend requests.\n8. Clone phishing: In this type of attack, the attacker creates a duplicate of a legitimate email and alters it to contain malicious content or a link to a malicious website. The impact can be severe, as the attacker can gain access to the victim's accounts and steal personal information. The attack flow involves the attacker creating a duplicate of a legitimate email, making changes to the content, and then sending it to the victim.\n9. Dropbox phishing: This type of attack involves the attacker sending an email that appears to be from Dropbox, asking the victim to click on a link to a shared document.
