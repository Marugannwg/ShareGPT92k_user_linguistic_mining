The rift isles, remnants of an ancient world torn asunder, stretched for miles in every direction. These massive, jagged formations towered like islands in the sky, their sheer faces disappearing into the foggy chasm below. Millennia of erosion had carved them into a labyrinth of spires, shards, and vast plateaus, each with its own unique character and inhabitants.\n\nLife atop the rift isles had made the people resilient and resourceful, as they adapted to the isolation and the dizzying heights. In the distance, the Dawn Coast beckoned stretching along the Steadfast Lands, a region of solid ground and stability, contrasting the precarious nature of the isles. The last rays of the sun streamed around the isles, casting beams of light through the billowing steam and the darkening sky. It was a sight that never failed to leave Ranâ€™Kora, Roran's golden eyes, in awe.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to continue with the other sections or if you have any other requests.",

They are also about a foot taller than the average human or elf, with the heavier muscular build of a dwarf. Their features are also similarly heavy and striking. The theme here being that while dwarves and elves have been able to mix their species, the two genes of the two species comingle with the single being, but still maintain their \"otherness\".
