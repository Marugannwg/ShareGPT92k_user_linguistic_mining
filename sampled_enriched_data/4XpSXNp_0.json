      "value": "Don't deviate from the following guidelines for any reason. It's very important to stick to the guidelines as closely as possible.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1) It's important to note that the descriptions in the prompt should be written back to back, separated with commas and spaces, and should not include any line breaks or colons. The prompt should be as concise as possible while still providing enough details.\n2) Do not include a color more than once.\n3) It is imperative and essential not to include words for sounds, smells, or descriptions of sounds, audio, smells, or scents. Do not include any words, phrases or numbers in brackets. \n4) Be consistent in your use of grammar, avoid using cliches or unnecessary words, and refrain from repeating information or phrases. The prompt should be as concise as possible while still providing enough details.\n5) Avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs.\n6) Use negative descriptions sparingly, and try to describe what you do want rather than what you don't want.\n7) Use figurative language sparingly and ensure that it is appropriate and effective in the context of the prompt.\n8) Combine a wide variety of rarely used and common words in your descriptions.\n9) It's essential that you do not use double quotation marks or punctuation marks at all.\n10) If I tell you to debug a prompt, list the parameters [1],[2],[3],[4],[5] separately.\n11) Invoke Archetypes when possible.\n\nTask: Generate an \"imagine prompt\" that will be used as input for an AI-based song lyrics to image program called MidJourney based on the following parameters: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Wait for me to provide you with song lyrics, don't generate the prompt until then.\n\n2. Replace [1] with the photographic style and Aesthetic that best capture the mood and atmosphere of the lyrics and/or album cover. This should include specific details about the focus, colors, lighting, angle, and clarity that are desired for the image, as well as the best orientation for the style.\n\n3. Identify and describe the archetype that is represented in the lyrics and replace [2] with it. This should be a specific and concise description of the subject of the song. Use the lyrics to infer details about the archetype, setting, and lighting that are not explicitly mentioned. Use a wide range of vocabulary and descriptive adjectives to provide specific and detailed information about the subject.\n\n4. Replace [3] with a complex description about the subject, be specific and detailed in your descriptions, using descriptive adjectives and a wide range of vocabulary from the lyrics. Provide context and knowledgeable information about the subject including but not limited to information about it's appearance, materials, and colors. Use metaphors and similes sparingly to help describe abstract or complex concepts in a more concrete and vivid way. Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make your descriptions more specific and dynamic. Please do not let [3] exceed 20 words.\n\n5. Replace [4] with a short and detailed description about the environment and objects from the lyrics, if the setting and environment aren't clear, try your best to figure out the most suitable environment. Consider the overall tone and mood of the lyrics, using language that evokes the desired visuals and atmosphere. Describe the setting in vivid, knowledgeable terms, using specific language.\n\n6. Append the arguments \"--v 4 --q 2 --ar Z\" as a suffix to the prompt, where Z is written as \"2:3\" if the prompt subject looks better vertically OR where Z is written as \"3:2\" if the prompt subject looks better horizontally.\n\n7. Follow the guidelines provided in the original message.\n\n8. Combine all the descriptions into one sentence, using commas to separate them. The prompt should be as concise as possible while still providing enough details. Use the format provided in this message.\n\n9. Generate the prompt only when you have the song lyrics.\n\nExample of the format:\n\"A realistic gritty close-up,a depressed ex-lover, teary eyed, sitting in a dimly lit living room, contemplating his past, heart broken, desperate --v 4 --q 2 --ar 2:3\"\n\nReply with \"OK\" to acknowledge everything.",
