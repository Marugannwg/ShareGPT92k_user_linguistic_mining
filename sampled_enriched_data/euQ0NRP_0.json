      "value": "\"Lost\" is a TV show that uses a non-linear narrative structure to tell its story. The show follows a group of plane crash survivors who find themselves stranded on a mysterious island with various supernatural elements.\n\nThe narrative structure of \"Lost\" is primarily focused on the use of flashbacks, flash-forwards, and flash-sideways to provide insight into the characters and their backstories. This approach allows the show to explore each character's past in a way that is directly related to their present situation on the island.\n\nThe show often uses flashbacks to reveal important information about a character's motivations or past experiences that are relevant to the current plot. These flashbacks are usually triggered by a character's actions or thoughts, and they often help to explain why the character is behaving in a particular way.\n\nIn addition to flashbacks, the show also uses flash-forwards to give viewers a glimpse into what the characters' lives might be like after they are rescued from the island. These flash-forwards often provide shocking and unexpected revelations about the characters and the overall plot of the show.\n\nThe show's final season also introduced a new narrative structure known as the flash-sideways. This narrative structure showed an alternate reality where the characters never crashed on the island, providing a fresh perspective on the show's characters and their relationships.\n\nOverall, the narrative structure of \"Lost\" is complex and multi-layered, using a variety of techniques to provide viewers with a deep understanding of the characters and their experiences on the island.",

This show is a fantasy adventure show in a fictional world where all of the good and evil characters from classic (public domain) literature exist. This show is also like the show 24 where it takes place in real time. Each episode is an hour of the show. Episode 1 is 4pm, Episode 2 is 5pm and so on. Before the show begins, a dark evil curse has been brought forth by the evil creatures of the world, a darkness that spreads when good is destroyed. This curse will only last a year unless all good is destroyed. If a single good being is left alive after exactly 1 year at midnight, the curse is reversed, and time is reversed to before the curse began. Every being that has been killed over the last year will come back to life. All destruction will be put back to the way it was. When the show begins, all of the good beings left in the world have been driven to King Arthur's castle. It is surrounded by evil creatures for miles. In the first scene, King Arthur is fighting to keep the bridge to the castle free. The only thing keeping out the evil from the castle is a force field that the last handful of good wizards are keeping up. They've been chanting for days and weeks to keep the spell going, but the power is so much that they slowly begin dying one by one. Once the last wizard dies in the middle of the season, the evil are able to storm the castle. The good characters fight until the last person standing. All they need is one to live at the stroke of midnight and the curse will be reversed. Main characters include Robin Hood, Lancelot, Merlin, Joan of Arc, Ivanhoe, D'artagnan, and add other relevant public domain characters that would fit in the story.",
