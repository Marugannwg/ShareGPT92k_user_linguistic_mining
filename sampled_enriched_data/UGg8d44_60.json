The Before-After-Bridge copywriting framework is designed to highlight the transformation that a person can experience after using a product or service.\n\nThe reason why these two frameworks work well together is that they both focus on transformation and growth. By combining them, you can create a powerful narrative that speaks to your audience's desire for personal development and improvement.\n\nFor example, imagine you are selling a personal development course that helps people overcome self-doubt and build self-confidence. By using the Coming of Age archetype, you can frame the course as a journey of self-discovery, where the customer will face challenges and obstacles, but ultimately emerge as a more confident and self-assured person.\n\nThen, by using the Before-After-Bridge framework, you can show the customer what their life will be like after completing the course. You can highlight the benefits of increased self-confidence, such as improved relationships, better career opportunities, and greater overall happiness. By painting this picture of what's possible, you can create a sense of excitement and motivation that encourages the customer to take action and enroll in the course.\n\nOverall, the Coming of Age story archetype and the Before-After-Bridge copywriting framework work well together because they tap into a fundamental human desire for growth and transformation. By combining these frameworks in your marketing messages, you can create a compelling narrative that speaks to your audience's deepest aspirations and motivates them to take action.",
