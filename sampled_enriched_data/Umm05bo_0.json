      "value": "Here is the synopsis: TIJUANA, MEXICO, IN THE YEAR 2060: In the aftermath of the second Mexican-American war, where Mexico and the newly independent militarized breakaway state of Texas fought for control of the disputed lands of Northern Mexico, tens of thousands of dismembered soldiers return home. Texas and Northern Mexico have formed a new ultra-militarized authoritarian state. \nTechnology has reached a point of sophistication where man and machine come together and are virtually indistinguishable. Amid the National rebuilding effort, social strata are defined by those who are able-bodied and strong versus those who are weak and unable to contribute to rebuilding society. Citizens with mental illness and disabilities are at the bottom of society. \nEconomic ruin has left the Mexican government without the financial resources to support a social safety net, and the government can no longer subsidize the health and recovery of returning soldiers who gave life and limb for their country. Partly backed by the Chinese government, a police state emerges in order to maintain the new social order. \nThe “New Man” is defined by strength, endurance, embedded technology, and advanced materials developed from cutting edge science. Cyborgs occupy the top of the societal food chain - part man, part machine, and highly valued for their quantum-like intelligence, social skills, and physical prowess. The “New Man” (which include woman) can define themselves in whatever way they want - shape, color, personality, and sex. \nIn the red-light district of Tijuana, a newly formed transnational gang controls the emergent black market for embedded quantum computers and advanced materials and technology used for enhancing or replacing human body parts. This technology is highly sought by those desperate for acceptance, upward mobility, and (in some cases) for self-identification and expression. Outside of this black market, only the elite can legitimately access this life-changing technology. \nAmid this new social tension and economic chaos, an underground hero emerges. Raised by humble descendants of the Aztec warriors, he served with distinction in the War, until he loses his legs in a roadside improvised bomb explosion. Now in a wheelchair, he works as a down-and-out cashier and wheel-bound busboy in one of the seedy nightclubs and love hotels of Tijuana, catering to the whims of the elite. There he is befriended by an exotic dancer and comfort girl who connects him with a black-market broker of cyborg body parts and quantum technology. The shadowy broker sympathizes and identifies with our hero’s disability, his heroism, and his sense of honor. He decides to help him with a pair of cyborg legs and outdated, but usable, embedded quantum firmware. \nThe favor comes with a price, however. In exchange for the broker’s “good deed”, our hero is tasked with a mission to track down, access, and steal the firmware and codebase to the latest quantum software sought by the broker’s powerful client buyer, who intends to access and manipulate the most powerful levers of societal control. \nOur hero’s mission will place him in direct conflict with the dark forces of the government, agents of corrupt corporate interests, and narco transnational gangs - all of whom want control of the latest technology. Most of all, our hero’s mission will place him in conflict with his own moral identity. At stake . . . the power to control the new cyborg social order. \nThe themes explored in Zona Norte deal with ambiguity at every turn: cultural, ethnic, sexual, and moral - all within the context of the surveillance state. In an age where access to technology means ultimate power, the rules can change at any moment. Chaos is the only constant.",
