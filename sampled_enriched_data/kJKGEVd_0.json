generative AI tools like chat GPT gpt3 mid-journey text to speech and who knows what kind of tools we will get in the upcoming year so let's just dive in and see how I do this so you can too my process starts over at chat GPT here I just go brainstorm 5 ideas around how-to topics for a YouTube video so here you should get some very good tips to use in your video so here we got 10 life facts for a more productive day so let's just use that since this is going to be a shorter video let's just take down to five so let's just copy that head over to our script and paste it as our topic okay so our other script let's just run that what is your how-to topic just paste that since we got Not Gonna Take 10 we're just gonna do five and let's run that and see what we get back foreign let's look at some results here so we got our mid Journey prompts we got our voiceover so here you can see some examples of mid Journey prompts sitting at your desk plan a list of tasks cartoon style Vector art yeah we got all things we need here and we have this nice voiceover script let's just start by copying our voiceover script and head over to create our voiceover so in this case we are over at Azure speech Studio there are many other text-to-speech engines you can run let's just paste our script here let's go for export export the local disk save as MP3 and just hit export and that is our voiceover done we need some images let's head back to our mid-journey prompts just copy this head over to me Journey slash imagine just paste our prompt here and hit enter and let's see what we get back so we got some results back here let's just open that and see what what they have here yeah I think this should work we have it in the vertical format that's gonna be perfect for our shorts and I was just picking the images you like the most that you are gonna use in your video finally we have all our images we have our voiceover now it's just a simple editing job just combine all your images with your voice over here as in this case I am using Premiere Pro you can use whatever software you want so let's just finish up this this is the last image paste okay and let's have a quick listen before we watch the full result increase your productivity each day and get more done with the white focus and dedication you'll be amazed at the results yeah that sounds good if you want to learn how to create scripts like the one I used in this video you should definitely check out my membership page and we are also starting up in 2023 with the community YouTube channel where we will do testing and see what kind of videos we can create with generative AI tools and that is going to be very exciting so as I said check out the link in the description below and now let's just have a look at some final results first make a to-do list write down all the tasks that need to be completed and keep track of them it's an easy way to stay organized visualize your tasks and reduce stress second avoid multitasking many think it helps productivity but it actually has the opposite effect instead focus on completing one task at a time and get more done in less time third establish a routine that works for you to create structure and organization in your life include key tasks you'd like to complete each day and practice sticking to the same sequence of tasks fourth take breaks they're essential they help clear your mind and give you a break from thinking when you come back you'll be better able to focus and Tackle more tasks finally develop positive habits try planning ahead focusing on the task at hand and taking time to prioritize each day the more positive habits you practice the better your productivity will be these five life hacks can help you to increase your productivity each day and get more done with the white focus and dedication you'll be amazed at the results Celia felt like she was being watched everywhere she went she sensed the presence nearby though she could not see it it was getting harder and harder to focus on her everyday tasks as her mind was filled with questions who was watching her and why then one day out of the blue she began to receive strange and cryptic messages on her phone they were from an unknown sender and each one contained a new clue for her to unravel Celia quickly realized that following these Clues was her only way to uncover the truth about her past and the Mysterious forces that she now felt were at work around her Celia followed the clues until finally she found herself standing in the middle of the woods in front of her she saw something that made her gasp in horror something that confirmed her suspicions that her life had been far more than she had once thought Celia carefully stepped closer hoping to make sense of what she was looking at then right before her eyes a figure appeared in the darkness he was tall and menacing and spoke to her in a deep and menacing voice she didn't know what to do but she was determined to get answers after an intense exchange of words the figure Finally Revealed that Celia was actually the daughter of a powerful Mage from another realm he said that her magical inheritance had been stolen from her many years ago and she was now on the brink of uncovering the truth about the mysterious forces that had kept her in the dark for so long Celia was filled with an incredible mix of emotions but she quickly stealed her nerves and vowed to face whatever challenge awaits her she had no idea what this new and dangerous Journey would bring but with each step she was faced with wilder and more mysterious Adventures Celia knew that the only way to uncover the truth was to press on no matter how treacherous the path may be\"\nVideo Summary:",

They suggest brainstorming ideas for a video, using Chat GPT to generate prompts and a voiceover script, and then using Azure speech Studio to create a voiceover recording. They also mention using mid-journey's image generation tool to create visual elements for the video, and then using video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro to combine the voiceover, images, and other elements into a finished video. The speaker also mentions starting a community YouTube channel in 2023 that will explore the possibilities of using generative AI tools to create videos.",
