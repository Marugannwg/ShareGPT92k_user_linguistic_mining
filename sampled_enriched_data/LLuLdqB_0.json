      "value": "In the `mpileup` file format, the fifth column contains the read bases at a particular genomic position. The $ and ^ symbols are special characters that can appear in this column, and they have specific meanings:\n\n* The $ symbol indicates the end of a read. It is used when a read does not extend all the way to the end of the alignment, and there are no more bases to report for that read at that position.\n* The ^ symbol indicates the start of a read, and is followed by a single character that represents a mapping quality score. This is used to indicate that the next base(s) in the read are the first bases of a new read alignment.\n\nFor example, the following `mpileup` line:\n```css\nchr1  100  A  10  aaaaaaAAAA  IIIIIIIIII\n```\nindicates that at position 100 on chromosome 1, there are 10 reads that align to this position, and the reference base is A. The read bases are `aaaaaaAAAA`, and the base quality scores are `IIIIIIIIII`. There are no $ or ^ symbols in this example.\n\nHowever, if one of the reads stopped before the end of the alignment, the $ symbol would be used to indicate this. For example:\n```css\nchr1  100  A  10  aaaaaaAA$  IIIIIIIIII\n```\nindicates that one of the reads that aligns to position 100 stops before the end of the alignment, and there are no more bases to report for that read at this position.\n\nSimilarly, if a read starts at this position and there are additional bases in the read that align to subsequent positions, the ^ symbol would be used to indicate this. For example:\n```css\nchr1  100  A  10  aaaaaaAAAA  IIIIIIIIII\nchr1  101  T  12  ^BTTTTtttttT  IIIIIIIIIII\n```\nindicates that there are 12 reads that align to position 101, and one of those reads starts at position 100 and has a mapping quality score of B. The read bases at position 101 are `TTTTTtttttT`, and the base quality scores are `IIIIIIIIIII`.",
