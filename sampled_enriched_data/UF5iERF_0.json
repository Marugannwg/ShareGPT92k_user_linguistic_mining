EHR, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive record that also includes administrative and financial information, and is typically used by hospitals and other large healthcare organizations.\n2.

EMR is typically used by smaller practices and clinics, while EHR is used by larger healthcare organizations and hospitals.\n4. EMR is designed to meet the needs of a specific practice or clinic, while EHR is designed to meet the needs of a larger organization and comply with regulations and standards.\n5. EMR is more focused on the day-to-day care of patients, while EHR is more focused on the long-term management of a patient's health.\n6. EMR is typically only accessible to the providers who are directly involved in a patient's care, while EHR is accessible to a wider range of authorized healthcare providers, including specialists and primary care physicians.\n\nIn summary, EHR is more comprehensive, inclusive and geared towards long-term population health management while EMR is more focused on the day-to-day care of patients.",
