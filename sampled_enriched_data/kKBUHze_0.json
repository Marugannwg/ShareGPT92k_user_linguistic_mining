Here are the specific steps you would need to take to create a mobile application for both Android and iOS platforms that uses AI to transform a selfie of a person into their \"super saiyan\" form, including sound effects and auras:\n\n1. Develop a user interface (UI) design for the app that includes a button for taking a selfie and displaying the transformed image.\n2. Choose a development platform for the app. There are many options available, such as React Native, Xamarin, and Flutter, which allow you to create native apps for both Android and iOS platforms using a single codebase.\n3. Create a basic app skeleton using the chosen development platform, including the necessary code for taking and processing a selfie.\n4. Train a machine learning model to detect and recognize human faces in images, and to transform those faces into the desired \"super saiyan\" form. There are many pre-trained models available that can be fine-tuned for this task, such as OpenCV or MTCNN, with a dataset of labeled images of people in the \"super saiyan\" form.\n5. Integrate the trained machine learning model into the app, so that it can process the selfie taken by the user and display the transformed image on the app's UI.\n6. Implement sound effects and auras in the app, such as playing a sound effect when the transformation occurs and displaying an aura around the transformed image.\n7. Test the app on both Android and iOS platforms to ensure that it works as expected and fix any bugs that are found.\n8. Publish the app on the Google Play Store for Android and the App Store for iOS.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a non-trivial task and would require a good amount of technical knowledge in computer vision, machine learning, and mobile app development. It's also worth noting that your app should comply with the policies of the stores, and with the copyright laws, as using copyrighted material without permission could get you into legal troubles.",
