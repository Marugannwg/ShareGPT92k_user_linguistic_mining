      "value": "The website <https://www.notionmastery.com/> is not built entirely on Notion. While the Notion Mastery course content is hosted within the Notion platform, the main website itself is designed using a different web development platform, such as Webflow, WordPress, or Squarespace.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of how the website was likely made:\n\n1. Choose a platform: The creator, Marie Poulin, chose a web development platform, like Webflow, WordPress, or Squarespace, to design and host the main website.\n2. Register a domain: A custom domain ([www.notionmastery.com](http://www.notionmastery.com)) was registered to give the website a professional and memorable web address.\n3. Design the website: The website was designed using the chosen platform's tools, incorporating visual elements, typography, and layout that resonate with the intended audience and reflect the brand identity.\n4. Create the content: Marie Poulin developed the content for the website, including text, images, and videos, to communicate the value proposition, course details, and testimonials from students.\n5. Set up the course on Notion: The course content, lessons, templates, and other resources were created and organized within Notion. Access to the course material is granted to students upon enrollment.\n6. Integrate payment and enrollment: The website was connected to a payment processor, such as Stripe, and an email marketing platform, such as ConvertKit or Mailchimp, to manage payments and enroll students in the course.\n7. Connect the website to the course: Once the payment and enrollment process is completed, students receive an email with a link to access the course content on Notion.\n8. Promote the website: Marie Poulin promotes the Notion Mastery course through various channels, including social media, email marketing, and partnerships with other creators or platforms.\n\nIn summary, the Notion Mastery website is built using a web development platform, while the course content itself is hosted on Notion. This approach allows the creator to have a visually appealing and functional website while leveraging the power of Notion for organizing and delivering the course material.",
